  abstract = {It has long been speculated that the backpropagation-of-error algorithm (backprop) may be a model of how the brain learns. Backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) is the canonical temporal-analogue to backprop used to assign credit in recurrent neural networks in machine learning, but there's even less conviction about whether BPTT has anything to do with the brain. Even in machine learning the use of BPTT in classic neural network architectures has proven insufficient for some challenging temporal credit assignment (TCA) problems that we know the brain is capable of solving. Nonetheless, recent work in machine learning has made progress in solving difficult TCA problems by employing novel memory-based and attention-based architectures and algorithms, some of which are brain inspired. Importantly, these recent machine learning methods have been developed in the context of, and with reference to BPTT, and thus serve to strengthen BPTT's position as a useful normative guide for thinking about temporal credit assignment in artificial and biological systems alike.},

  abstract = {A striking finding in recent years has been that the transition from sleep to waking is accompanied in many brain regions by a widespread activation of c-fos and other immediate-early genes (IEGs). IEGs are induced by various electrical or chemical signals to which neural cells are exposed and their protein products act as transcription factors to regulate the expression of other genes. After a few hours of sleep, the expression of these transcription factors in the brain is absent or restricted to very few cells. However, after a few hours of spontaneous waking or sleep deprivation, the expression of c-fos and other IEGs is high in cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, septum, and several thalamic and brainstem nuclei. While cells expressing c-fos during waking are widely distributed, they represent only a subset of all neurons in any given area. These observations raise several questions: Why is c-fos expressed during waking and not during sleep? Is waking always accompanied by c-fos induction? Which subset of cells express c-fos during waking and why only a subset? Once c-fos has been induced, what are the functional consequences of its activation? In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the meaning of c-fos activation in the brain in relation to the sleep-waking cycle and suggest that c-fos induction in the cerebral cortex during waking might be related to the occurrence of plastic phenomena.},

  abstract = {Background: Circadian clocks are found in nearly all organisms, from bacteria to mammals, and ensure that behavioral and physiological processes occur at optimal times of day and in the correct temporal order. It is becoming increasingly clear that chronic circadian misalignment (CCM), such as occurs in shift workers or as a result of aberrant sleeping and eating schedules common to modern society, has profound metabolic and cognitive consequences, but the proximate mechanisms connecting CCM with reduced organismal health are unknown. Furthermore, it has been difficult to disentangle whether the health effects are directly induced by misalignment or are secondary to the alterations in sleep and activity levels that commonly occur with CCM. Here, we investigated the consequences of CCM in the powerful model system of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We subjected flies to daily 4-h phase delays in the light-dark schedule and used the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) system to continuously track locomotor activity and sleep while simultaneously monitoring fly lifespan.
Results: Consistent with previous results, we find that exposing flies to CCM leads to a \textasciitilde{} 15\% reduction in median lifespan in both male and female flies. Importantly, we demonstrate that the reduced longevity occurs independent of changes in overall sleep or activity. To uncover potential molecular mechanisms of CCM-induced reduction in lifespan, we conducted whole body RNA-sequencing to assess differences in gene transcription between control and misaligned flies. CCM caused progressive, large-scale changes in gene expression characterized by upregulation of genes involved in response to toxic substances, aging and oxidative stress, and downregulation of genes involved in regulation of development and differentiation, gene expression and biosynthesis.
Conclusions: Many of these gene expression changes mimic those that occur during natural aging, consistent with the idea that CCM results in premature organismal decline, however, we found that genes involved in lipid metabolism are overrepresented among those that are differentially regulated by CCM and aging. This category of genes is also among the earliest to exhibit CCM-induced changes in expression, thus highlighting altered lipid metabolism as a potentially important mediator of the negative health consequences of CCM.},

Unlike earlier tests using interpoint distances, the new test statistic has a known exact distribution and is exactly distribution free. The interpoint distances are used to construct an optimal non-bipartite matching, i.e. a matching of the observations into disjoint pairs to minimize the total distance within pairs. The cross-match statistic is the number of pairs containing one observation from the ﬁrst distribution and one from the second. Distributions that are very different will exhibit few cross-matches. When comparing two discrete distributions with ﬁnite support, the test is consistent against all alternatives. The test is applied to a study of brain activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during two linguistic tasks, comparing brains that are impaired by arteriovenous abnormalities with normal controls. A second exact distribution-free test is also discussed: it ranks the pairs and sums the ranks of the cross-matched pairs.},

  abstract = {The circadian system is entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle via retinal photoreceptors and regulates numerous aspects of physiology and behavior, including sleep. These processes are all key factors in healthy aging showing a gradual decline with age. Despite their importance, the exact mechanisms underlying this decline are yet to be fully understood. One of the most effective tools we have to understand the genetic factors underlying these processes are genetically inbred mouse strains. The most commonly used reference mouse strain is C57BL/6J, but recently, resources such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium have started producing large numbers of mouse mutant lines on a pure genetic background, C57BL/6N. Considering the substantial genetic diversity between mouse strains we expect there to be phenotypic differences, including differential effects of aging, in these and other strains. Such differences need to be characterized not only to establish how different mouse strains may model the aging process but also to understand how genetic background might modify age-related phenotypes. To ascertain the effects of aging on sleep/wake behavior, circadian rhythms, and light input and whether these effects are mouse strain-dependent, we have screened C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N, C3H-HeH, and C3H-Pde6b+ mouse strains at 5 ages throughout their life span. Our data show that sleep, circadian, and light input parameters are all disrupted by the aging process. Moreover, we have cataloged a number of strain-specific aging effects, including the rate of cataract development, decline in the pupillary light response, and changes in sleep fragmentation and the proportion of time spent asleep.},

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. We argue here that, to the contrary, philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science.

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, hearkening back to Plato, Aristotle, and others (here evoked with Raphael’s famous School of Athens), present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. To the contrary, we believe philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science. Image credit: Shutterstock.com/Isogood\_patrick.

We illustrate our point with three examples taken from various fields of the contemporary life sciences. Each bears on cutting-edge scientific research, and each has been explicitly acknowledged by practicing researchers as a useful contribution to science. These and other examples show that philosophy’s contribution can take at least four forms: the clarification of scientific concepts, the critical assessment of scientific assumptions or methods, the formulation of new concepts and theories, and the fostering of dialogue between different sciences, as well as between science and society.

\#\#\# Conceptual Clarification and Stem Cells.

First, philosophy offers conceptual clarification. Conceptual clarifications not only improve the precision and utility of scientific terms but also lead to novel experimental investigations because the choice of a given conceptual framework strongly constrains how experiments are conceived.

The definition of stem cells is a prime example. Philosophy has a long tradition of investigating properties, and the tools in use in this tradition …

  shorttitle = {Circadian Disruption},
  abstract = {The circadian system regulates physiology and behavior. Acute challenges to the system, such as those experienced when traveling across time zones, will eventually result in re-synchronization to local environmental time cues, but this re-synchronization is oftentimes accompanied by adverse short-term consequences. When such challenges are experienced chronically, adaptation may not be achieved, as for example in the case of rotating night shift workers. The transient and chronic disturbance of the circadian system is most frequently referred to as "circadian disruption", but many other terms have been proposed and used to refer to similar situations. It is now beyond doubt that the circadian system contributes to health and disease, emphasizing the need for clear terminology when describing challenges to the circadian system and their consequences. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the terms used to describe disruption of the circadian system, discuss proposed quantifications of disruption in experimental and observational settings with a focus on human research, and highlight limitations and challenges of currently available tools. For circadian research to advance as a translational science, clear, operationalizable, and scalable quantifications of circadian disruption are key, as they will enable improved assessment and reproducibility of results, ideally ranging from mechanistic settings, including animal research, to large-scale randomized clinical trials.},

As well as synchronising circadian rhythms to the external environment, light has been shown to modulate autonomic and neuroendocrine responses as well as regulating sleep and influencing cognitive processes such as attention, arousal and performance. The last two decades have seen major advances in our understanding of the retinal photoreceptors that mediate these non-image forming responses to light, as well as the neural pathways and molecular mechanisms by which circadian rhythms are generated and entrained to the external light/dark (LD) cycle. By contrast, our understanding of the mechanisms by which lighting influences cognitive processes are more equivocal. The effects of light on different cognitive processes are complex. As well as the direct effects of light, indirect effects may also occur due to disrupted circadian entrainment. Despite the widespread use of disrupted LD cycles to study the role circadian rhythms on cognition, the different experimental protocols used have subtly different effects on circadian function which are not comparable. Moreover, these protocols will also disrupt sleep and alter physiological arousal, both of which are known to modulate cognition. Studies have used different behavioural assays which are dependent upon different cognitive and sensory processes, which may also contribute to their variable findings. Here we propose that studies addressing the effects of different lighting conditions on cognitive processes must also account for their effects on circadian rhythms, sleep and arousal if we are to fully understand the physiological basis of these effects.},

We propose CIRBP to play a role because its rhythmic expression is i) sleep-wake driven and ii) necessary for high-amplitude clock-gene expression in vitro. We therefore expect Cirbp knock-out (KO) mice to exhibit attenuated sleep-deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression, and consequently to differ in their sleep homeostatic regulation. Lack of CIRBP indeed blunted the sleep-deprivation incurred changes in cortical expression of Nr1d1, whereas it amplified the changes in Per2 and Clock. Concerning sleep homeostasis, KO mice accrued only half the extra REM sleep wild-type (WT) littermates obtained during recovery. Unexpectedly, KO mice were more active during lights-off which was accompanied with faster theta oscillations compared to WT mice. Thus, CIRBP adjusts cortical clock-gene expression after sleep deprivation and expedites REM-sleep recovery.},

For one condition the same subjects (N = 16) received alternating 90-min blocks of BL and DL during the nighttime h (2300-0800 h) under sustained wakefulness conditions. A second condition was similar to the first except that subjects (N = 8) received photic stimulation during the daytime hours. For the third and fourth conditions different subjects received either continuous BL (N = 10) or continuous DL (N = 9) during the nighttime hours. For the nighttime alternating condition body temperature decreased under DL but either increased or maintained under BL. For the continuous light condition, body temperature dropped sharply across the night under DL but dropped only slightly under BL. Sleepiness was considerably greater under DL than under BL, and the difference became larger as the night progressed. Similarly, alertness, measured by EEG beta activity, was greater under BL, and nighttime performance on behavioral tasks was also generally better. There were no differential effects between BL and DL on any measure during the daytime. These data indicate that light exerts a powerful, immediate effect on physiology and behavior in addition to its powerful influence on circadian organization.},

  abstract = {Both the pineal hormone melatonin and light exposure are considered to play a major role in the circadian regulation of sleep. In a placebo- controlled balanced cross-over design, we investigated the acute effects of exogenous melatonin (5 mg p.o. at 20.40 hours) with or without a 3-h bright light exposure (5000 lux from 21.00 hours-24.00 hours) on subjective sleepiness, internal sleep structure and EEG power density during sleep and wakefulness in healthy young men. The acute effects of melatonin, bright light and their interaction were measured on the first day (treatment day), possible circadian phase shifts were assessed on the post-treatment day. On the treatment day, the evening rise in subjective sleepiness was accelerated after melatonin and protracted during bright light exposure. These effects were also reflected in specific changes of EEG power density in the theta/alpha range during wakefulness. Melatonin shortened and bright light increased sleep latency. REMS latency was reduced after melatonin administration but bright light had no effect. Slow-wave sleep and slow-wave activity during the first non-rapid eye movement (NREMS) episode were suppressed after melatonin administration and rebounded in the second NREMS episode, independent of whether light was co-administered or not. Self rated sleep quality was better after melatonin administration whereas the awakening process was rated as more difficult after bright light. On the post-treatment day after evening bright light, the rise in sleepiness and the onset of sleep were delayed, independent of whether melatonin was co-administered or not. Thus, although acute bright light and melatonin administration affected subjective sleepiness, internal sleep structure and EEG power density during sleep and wakefulness in a additive manner, the phase shifting effect of a single evening bright light exposure could not be blocked by exogenous melatonin.},

These rhythms are based upon a molecular clock generated via an intracellular transcriptional-translational feedback loop involving a number of key clock genes. However, to be of practical use, circadian rhythms need to be entrained to the external environment. In mammals, the primary signal for entrainment is light detected by the photoreceptors of the eye. Research on the mechanisms of photic entrainment has identified a novel photoreceptor system in the retina, consisting of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin. Light input from these retinal photoreceptors reaches the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract, where it then interacts with the molecular clock to bring about entrainment. This chapter focuses on the retinal photoreceptors mediating entrainment, and how light information from the retina is transmitted to the SCN, before detailing recent advances in our understanding of how the molecular clock within the SCN is regulated by light input. Finally, the primary assays that have been used to measure photic entrainment are described.},

  abstract = {Multisynaptic neural and endocrine pathways from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus have been hypothesized to communicate circadian and photic information to the adrenal glands. In humans, light exposure has been reported to have no effect, increase, or decrease cortisol levels. These inconsistent findings in humans may be related to differences among studies including the intensity (approximately 500 to 5500 lux), duration (15 min to 4 h), and circadian phase of light exposure. The authors assessed the influence of exposure to bright light on cortisol levels in humans during the rising and descending phases of the circadian rhythm of cortisol, that is, when cortisol levels are high. Twenty healthy men and women were studied using a within-subject research design. Subjects were studied in an environment free of time cues for 9 to 10 days. Subjects received a 6.7-h exposure of bright light (approximately 10,000 lux; equivalent to ambient light intensity just after sunrise or just before sunset) or dim light (approximately 3 lux; equivalent to candle light) during the biological night and morning. Bright light exposure significantly reduced plasma cortisol levels at both circadian phases studied, whereas dim light exposure had little effect on cortisol levels. The finding of an acute suppressive effect of bright light exposure on cortisol levels supports the existence of a mechanism by which photic information can acutely influence the human adrenal glands.},

  abstract = {Temporal organization of physiology is critical for human health. In the past, humans experienced predictable periods of daily light and dark driven by the solar day, which allowed for entrainment of intrinsic circadian rhythms to the environmental light-dark cycles. Since the adoption of electric light, however, pervasive exposure to nighttime lighting has blurred the boundaries of day and night, making it more difficult to synchronize biological processes. Many systems are under circadian control, including sleep-wake behavior, hormone secretion, cellular function and gene expression. Circadian disruption by nighttime light perturbs those processes and is associated with increasing incidence of certain cancers, metabolic dysfunction and mood disorders. This review focuses on the role of artificial light at night in mood regulation, including mechanisms through which aberrant light exposure affects the brain. Converging evidence suggests that circadian disruption alters the function of brain regions involved in emotion and mood regulation. This occurs through direct neural input from the clock or indirect effects, including altered neuroplasticity, neurotransmission and clock gene expression. Recently, the aberrant light exposure has been recognized for its health effects. This review summarizes the evidence linking aberrant light exposure to mood.},

  abstract = {Circadian (daily) rhythms are present in almost all plants and animals. In mammals, a brain clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus maintains synchrony between environmental light/dark cycles and physiology and behavior. Over the past 100 y, especially with the advent of electric lighting, modern society has resulted in a round-the-clock lifestyle, in which natural connections between rest/activity cycles and environmental light/dark cycles have been degraded or even broken. Instances in which rapid changes to sleep patterns are necessary, such as transmeridian air travel, demonstrate negative effects of acute circadian disruption on physiology and behavior. However, the ramifications of chronic disruption of the circadian clock for mental and physical health are not yet fully understood. By housing mice in 20-h light/dark cycles, incongruous with their endogenous ∼24-h circadian period, we were able to model the effects of chronic circadian disruption noninvasively. Housing in these conditions results in accelerated weight gain and obesity, as well as changes in metabolic hormones. In the brain, circadian-disrupted mice exhibit a loss of dendritic length and decreased complexity of neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex, a brain region important in executive function and emotional control. Disrupted animals show decreases in cognitive flexibility and changes in emotionality consistent with the changes seen in neural architecture. How our findings translate to humans living and working in chronic circadian disruption is unknown, but we believe that this model can provide a foundation to understand how environmental disruption of circadian rhythms impacts the brain, behavior, and physiology.},

These include the synchronization of the circadian clock to the solar day, tracking of seasonal changes and the regulation of sleep. Irregular light environments lead to problems in circadian rhythms and sleep, which eventually cause mood and learning deficits. Recently, it was found that irregular light can also directly affect mood and learning without producing major disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep. In this Review, we discuss the indirect and direct influence of light on mood and learning, and provide a model for how light, the circadian clock and sleep interact to influence mood and cognitive functions.},

Our ability to perform mathematical calculations or other intellectual tasks between 04.00 and 06.00 h is worse than if we had consumed several shots of whisky and would be classified as legally drunk. Biological clocks drive or alter our sleep patterns, alertness, mood, physical strength, blood pressure and every other aspect of our physiology and behaviour. Our emerging understanding of how these 24 h rhythms are generated and regulated is not only one of the great success stories of modern biology, but is also informing many areas of human health. Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a feature shared by some of the most challenging diseases of our time, including neuropsychiatric illness and serious disorders of the eye. Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption is also commonly seen across many sectors of society, from teenagers to shift workers. We also now appreciate that SCRD is far more than feeling sleepy at an inappropriate time. It promotes multiple illnesses ranging across abnormal metabolism, heart disease, reduced immunity, increased stress and abnormal cognition and mood states. This short review considers how 24 h rhythms are generated and regulated, the consequences of working against our body clock and the emerging relationship between SCRD and mental illness.},

Wheel-running activity was monitored in the laboratory with 44 individuals to document the presence of free-running circadian rhythms and ability to entrain to light-dark cycles. Twenty-two individuals were returned to the desert site of origin, including 12 intact control animals and 10 animals whose circadian timing had been disrupted by SCN-lesioning. Time of activity was recorded continuously for 15 days in a large outdoor enclosure by a motion detector, a microchip transponder detector, and video surveillance. An unplanned nighttime attack by a feral cat resulted in the death of 60\% of the SCN-lesioned animals and 29\% of the control animals in the enclosure. Surface activity of SCN-lesioned animals at the food cache occurred both in daytime and at night, ranging from 16.0\% nighttime activity for one partially lesioned individual to 52.1\% for one completely lesioned animal. Controls were strongly day-active, with nighttime surface trips constituting only 0-1.3\% of all excursions to the cache. Nine wild free-ranging individuals, including one with a radiotransmitter collar, were exclusively day-active. One of the functions of the SCN in mammals may be to reduce activity of animals during times that are unfavorable for activity.},

  abstract = {Coordinated daily rhythms are evident in most aspects of our physiology, driven by internal timing systems known as circadian clocks. Our understanding of how biological clocks are built and function has grown exponentially over the past 20 years. With this has come an appreciation that disruption of the clock contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, from metabolic disease to neurological disorders to cancer. However, it remains to be determined whether it is the disruption of our rhythmic physiology per se (loss of timing itself), or altered functioning of individual clock components that drive pathology. Here, we review the importance of circadian rhythms in terms of how we (and other organisms) relate to the external environment, but also in relation to how internal physiological processes are coordinated and synchronized. These issues are of increasing importance as many aspects of modern life put us in conflict with our internal clockwork.},

Under ordinary conditions, this device keeps time independently of all external and internal disturbances except light. To determine whether exposure to alternating periods of light and darkness of day and night plays any role in establishing this clock, tests were made on 20 rats blinded just after birth and on 6 congenitally blind rats. Both groups manifested this clock by alternating 12-hr phases of activity and inactivity. Results indicate that (a) the clock is inherent; (b) that it must have been built into the nervous system by a survival process in relation to alternating periods of light and darkness of day and night; and (c) that it must have originated in early evolutionary eras in the tropics where day and night have the same length, i.e., 12 hr.

  doi = {10.1146/annurev.ph.47.030185.000405},
  abstract = {A number of different experimental findings indicate that endogenous circadian neural rhythms are generated within the SCN region of mammals. Rhythmic neural signals from the SCN directly, or indirectly, appear to regulate many, if not all, biochemical, physiological, and behavioral circadian rhythms. The circadian system in mammals is referred to as being "multioscillatory" in nature, although this term is often used to mean different things. The SCN itself may contain many circadian neural oscillators and the coordinated output of these multioscillators may regulate circadian rhythms. The term multioscillatory is also used to indicate the presence of anatomically distinct oscillators. However, the location and properties of circadian pacemakers that may lie outside of the SCN region remain unknown. Indeed, there is no conclusive evidence that circadian rhythms can be generated over a prolonged period of time in the absence of the SCN in mammals maintained under constant environmental conditions. Whereas the SCN appears capable of generating circadian neural signals indefinitely in the absence of any 24-hr fluctuations in the external environment, other components of the circadian system may function as damped oscillators (i.e. persist for only a few cycles in the absence of a periodic input) and/or only emit diurnal rhythms in the presence of rhythmic input from either the external (e.g. light-dark cycle) and/or internal (e.g. SCN) environment. On a conceptual as well as a physiological level, our understanding of the organization of the mammalian circadian system remains limited at the present time. Unfortunately, the limitations on our understanding of the circadian system are not always fully appreciated, and quite often a hypothesis based on limited experimental data is treated as fact. The study of the circadian system is still in the early stages of development, and further progress in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the generation and expression of circadian rhythms may require new ways of looking at old problems as well as new experimental approaches. One final comment should be made concerning the importance of an increased understanding of circadian rhythms for human health. Because the study of the physiology of the circadian system is still in its early stages of development, little is known about the importance of the normal functioning of the circadian system for the health and well-being of the organism. Recent studies in humans suggest that disorders within the circadian system itself may be involved in the etiology of at least some forms of mental illness.},

  abstract = {Understanding the neurophysiology of the circadian timing system requires investigation at multiple levels of organization. Neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function as autonomous single-cell oscillators, which warrant studies at the single-cell level. Combining patch-clamp recordings of ion channels with imaging techniques to measure clock gene expression and intracellular calcium has proven extremely valuable to study cellular properties. To achieve and maintain rhythmic activity, SCN neurons require sufficient stimulation (i.e., input) from surrounding cells. At the network level, SCN rhythms are robust and can be measured in vitro, for example, in brain slices that contain the SCN. These recordings revealed that the collective behavior of the SCN neuronal network is strongly determined by the phase dispersal of the neurons. This phase dispersal is plastic, with high synchronization in short photoperiod, desynchronization in long photoperiod, and antiphase oscillations in aging and/or continuous light. In vivo recordings are needed in order to study the SCN as part of a larger network (i.e., interacting with other brain centers) and to study the SCN's response to light. Interestingly, superimposed on the circadian waveform are higher frequency fluctuations that are present in vivo but not in vitro. These fluctuations are attributed to input from other brain centers and computational analyses suggest that these fluctuations are beneficial to the system. Hence, the SCN's properties arise from several organizational levels, and a combination of approaches is needed in order to fully understand the circadian system.},

  abstract = {Within the mammalian hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains a circadian clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms. By culturing cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode arrays, we have been able to record spontaneous action potentials from individual SCN neurons for days or weeks, revealing prominent circadian rhythms in firing rate. Despite abundant functional synapses, circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture are not synchronized. After reversible blockade of neuronal firing lasting 2.5 days, circadian firing rhythms re-emerge with unaltered phases. These data suggest that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators, and that synapses formed in vitro are neither necessary for operation of these oscillators nor sufficient for synchronizing them.},

Circadian Rev-erbalpha expression is controlled by components of the general feedback loop. Thus, REV-ERBalpha constitutes a molecular link through which components of the negative limb drive antiphasic expression of components of the positive limb.

  volume = {26},
  issn = {1365-2826},
  doi = {10.1111/jne.12125},
  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal circadian pacemaker of the brain. It co-ordinates the daily rhythms of sleep and wakefulness, as well as physiology and behaviour, that set the tempo to our lives. Disturbance of this daily pattern, most acutely with jet-lag but more insidiously with rotational shift-work, can have severely deleterious effects for mental function and long-term health. The present review considers recent developments in our understanding of the properties of the SCN that make it a robust circadian time-keeper. It first focuses on the intracellular transcriptional/ translational feedback loops (TTFL) that constitute the cellular clockwork of the SCN neurone. Daily timing by these loops pivots around the negative regulation of the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes by their protein products. The period of the circadian cycle is set by the relative stability of Per and Cry proteins, and this can be controlled by both genetic and pharmacological interventions. It then considers the function of these feedback loops in the context of cytosolic signalling by cAMP and intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+) ]i ), which are both outputs from, and inputs to, the TTFL, as well as the critical role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signalling in synchronising cellular clocks across the SCN. Synchronisation by VIP in the SCN is paracrine, operating over an unconventionally long time frame (i.e. 24 h) and wide spatial domain, mediated via the cytosolic pathways upstream of the TTFL. Finally, we show how intersectional pharmacogenetics can be used to control G-protein-coupled signalling in individual SCN neurones, and how manipulation of Gq/[Ca(2+) ]i -signalling in VIP neurones can re-programme the circuit-level encoding of circadian time. Circadian pacemaking in the SCN therefore provides an unrivalled context in which to understand how a complex, adaptive behaviour can be organised by the dynamic activity of a relatively few gene products, operating in a clearly defined neuronal circuit, with both cell-autonomous and emergent, circuit-level properties.},

Experiments were performed on animals 80 days of age. Despite the loss of visual photoreceptors in the rd/rd retina, animals showed circadian responses to light that were indistinguishable from mice with normal retinas (rd/+ and +/+). While no photoreceptor outersegments were identified in the retina of rd/rd animals (80-100 days of age), we did identify a small number of perikarya that were immunoreactive for cone opsins, and even fewer cells that contained rod opsin. Using HPLC, we demonstrated the presence and photoisomerization of the rhodopsin chromophore 11-cis retinaldehyde. The rd/rd retinas contained about 2\% of 11-cis retinaldehyde found in +/+ retinas.

Animals were exposed from 30 to 110 days of age to long-day (14 h of light per day) or short-day (8 h of light per day) photoperiods. The reproductive system of neurologically-intact rats was not affected by exposure to short days. Nor did bulbectomy affect the reproductive system of rats exposed to long days. However, bulbectomized, short-day rats had significantly lower body weights, reduced testicular and seminal vesicle weights and lower plasma testosterone levels than did bulbectomized, long-day rats. The effects of short-day exposure on bulbectomized rats were prevented by pinealectomy. Short-day exposure and blinding exerted similar effects in bulbectomized rats. The testes of rats from all groups contained elongated spermatids; blinding and short-day treatment had no effect on spermatogenesis. Neither mating behavior nor the number of young sired was influenced by photoperiod in bulbectomized or intact rats. Removal of the olfactory bulbs unmasks photoperiodic responsiveness in rats; the antigonadal effects of short-day exposure are mediated by the pineal gland in bulbectomized rats as in species traditionally designated photoperiodic.

When PRV-Bartha is injected into one eye, it is taken up by retinal ganglion cells, replicated, transported to axon terminals in the SCN, and released. There the virus may take one, or both, of two paths to retinal ganglion cells in the contralateral eye: 1) uptake by SCN neurons, replication, and release from the neurons with uptake and retrograde transport in retinal afferents originating in the contralateral retina; 2) transneuronal passage through axo-axonic appositions between retinal afferents in the SCN with subsequent retrograde transport of virus to the contralateral retina. The ganglion cells thus labeled are a homogeneous population of small neurons (mean diameter, 12.8 +/- 2.2 microns and mean area, 81.8 +/- 21.8 microns 2) with sparsely branching dendrites that are widely distributed over the retina. This population is best identified when virus labeling of retinal projections in areas beyond the hypothalamus is eliminated by lateral geniculate lesions that transect the optic tract at its entry into the geniculate complex. The same population is labeled with retrograde tracers but, with both HRP and FluoroGold, other ganglion cells are labeled, presumably from uptake by fibers of passage, indicating that the virus is a more reliable marker for ganglion cells giving rise to retinohypothalamic projections.

  abstract = {The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract. Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, beta-galactosidase-positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex. Rat RGCs that exhibited intrinsic photosensitivity invariably expressed melanopsin. Hence, melanopsin is most likely the visual pigment of phototransducing RGCs that set the circadian clock and initiate other non-image-forming visual functions.},

On ablation of the melanopsin gene, retinal ganglion cells that normally express melanopsin are no longer intrinsically photosensitive. Furthermore, pupil reflex, light-induced phase delays of the circadian clock and period lengthening of the circadian rhythm in constant light are all partially impaired. Here, we investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate in these responses. Using mice lacking rods and cones, we measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the circadian rhythm of locomotor behaviour. This spectrum matches that for the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We have also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled with disabled rod and cone phototransduction mechanisms. These animals have an intact retina but fail to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus, the rod-cone and melanopsin systems together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory visual functions.},

  abstract = {In mammals, a small number of retinal ganglion cells express melanopsin, an opsin photopigment, allowing them to be directly photoreceptive. A major function of these so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is to synchronize (entrain) endogenous circadian clocks to the external light:dark cycle. Thanks to their intrinsic light response, ipRGCs can support photoentrainment even when the other retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are absent or inactive. However, in the intact retina the ipRGC light response is a composite of extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) influences. As a result all three photoreceptor classes contribute to the retinal pathways providing light information to the clock. Here, we consider what each photoreceptor type contributes to the clock light response. We review electrophysiological and behavioral data pertinent to this question, primarily from laboratory rodents, drawing them together to provide a conceptual model in which each photoreceptor class plays a distinct role in encoding the light environment. We finally use this model to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in this field.},

Induction of the immediate-early gene c-fos was observed after a nighttime light pulse in both wild-type and knockout mice.

These retinal outputs support not only pattern vision but also non-image-forming (NIF) functions, which include circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex (PLR). In mammals, NIF functions are mediated by rods, cones and the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rod-cone photoreceptors and ipRGCs are complementary in signalling light intensity for NIF functions. The ipRGCs, in addition to being directly photosensitive, also receive synaptic input from rod-cone networks. To determine how the ipRGCs relay rod-cone light information for both image-forming and non-image-forming functions, we genetically ablated ipRGCs in mice. Here we show that animals lacking ipRGCs retain pattern vision but have deficits in both PLR and circadian photoentrainment that are more extensive than those observed in melanopsin knockouts. The defects in PLR and photoentrainment resemble those observed in animals that lack phototransduction in all three photoreceptor classes. These results indicate that light signals for irradiance detection are dissociated from pattern vision at the retinal ganglion cell level, and animals that cannot detect light for NIF functions are still capable of image formation.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades there have been significant advances in our understanding of both the anatomy and function of the melanopsin system. It has become clear that rather than acting as a simple irradiance detector the melanopsin system is in fact far more complicated. The range of behavioural systems known to be influenced by melanopsin activity is increasing with time, and it is now clear that melanopsin contributes not only to multiple non-image forming systems but also has a role in visual pathways. How melanopsin is capable of driving so many different behaviours is unclear, but recent evidence suggests that the answer may lie in the diversity of melanopsin light responses and the functional specialisation of photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (pRGC) subtypes. In this review, we shall overview the current understanding of the melanopsin system, and evaluate the evidence for the hypothesis that individual pRGC subtypes not only perform specific roles, but are functionally specialised to do so. We conclude that while, currently, the available data somewhat support this hypothesis, we currently lack the necessary detail to fully understand how the functional diversity of pRGC subtypes correlates with different behavioural responses, and ultimately why such complexity is required within the melanopsin system. What we are lacking is a cohesive understanding of how light responses differ between the pRGC subtypes (based not only on anatomical classification but also based on their site of innervation); how these diverse light responses are generated, and most importantly how these responses relate to the physiological functions they underpin.},

They send axons directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), and olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), thereby contributing to photic synchronization of circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex. Here, we sought to characterize more fully the projections of these cells to the brain. By targeting tau-lacZ to the melanopsin gene locus in mice, ganglion cells that would normally express melanopsin were induced to express, instead, the marker enzyme beta-galactosidase. Their axons were visualized by X-gal histochemistry or anti-beta-galactosidase immunofluorescence. Established targets were confirmed, including the SCN, IGL, OPN, ventral division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv), and preoptic area, but the overall projections were more widespread than previously recognized. Targets included the lateral nucleus, peri-supraoptic nucleus, and subparaventricular zone of the hypothalamus, medial amygdala, margin of the lateral habenula, posterior limitans nucleus, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray. There were also weak projections to the margins of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Co-staining with the cholera toxin B subunit to label all retinal afferents showed that melanopsin ganglion cells provide most of the retinal input to the SCN, IGL, and lateral habenula and much of that to the OPN, but that other ganglion cells do contribute at least some retinal input to these targets. Staining patterns after monocular enucleation revealed that the projections of these cells are overwhelmingly crossed except for the projection to the SCN, which is bilaterally symmetrical.},

Light synchronizes this clock to the external environment by daily adjustments in the phase of the circadian oscillation. The mechanism has been thought to involve the release of excitatory amino acids from retinal afferents to the SCN. Brief treatment of rat SCN in vitro with glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or nitric oxide (NO) generators produced lightlike phase shifts of circadian rhythms. The SCN exhibited calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Antagonists of NMDA or NOS pathways blocked Glu effects in vitro, and intracerebroventricular injection of a NOS inhibitor in vivo blocked the light-induced resetting of behavioral rhythms. Together, these data indicate that Glu release, NMDA receptor activation, NOS stimulation, and NO production link light activation of the retina to cellular changes within the SCN mediating the phase resetting of the biological clock.},

Sets of currents are responsible for this daily rhythm, with the strongest evidence for persistent Na(+) currents, L-type Ca(2+) currents, hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(H)), large-conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) (BK) currents and fast delayed rectifier (FDR) K(+) currents.

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), site of the primary clock in the circadian rhythm system, has three major afferent connections. The most important consists of a retinohypothalamic projection through which photic information, received by classical rod/cone photoreceptors and intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells, gains access to the clock. This information influences phase and period of circadian rhythms. The two other robust afferent projections are the median raphe serotonergic pathway and the geniculohypothalamic (GHT), NPY-containing pathway from the thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). Beyond this simple framework, the number of anatomical routes that could theoretically be involved in rhythm regulation is enormous, with the SCN projecting to 15 regions and being directly innervated by about 35. If multisynaptic afferents to the SCN are included, the number expands to approximately brain 85 areas providing input to the SCN. The IGL, a known contributor to circadian rhythm regulation, has a still greater level of complexity. This nucleus connects abundantly throughout the brain (to approximately 100 regions) by pathways that are largely bilateral and reciprocal. Few of these sites have been evaluated for their contributions to circadian rhythm regulation, although most have a theoretical possibility of doing so via the GHT. The anatomy of IGL connections suggests that one of its functions may be regulation of eye movements during sleep. Together, neural circuits of the SCN and IGL are complex and interconnected. As yet, few have been tested with respect to their involvement in rhythm regulation.},

  abstract = {In view of mounting evidence that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is directly involved in the setting of sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to ACTH, the present study investigated possible anatomical and functional connections between SCN and adrenal. Transneuronal virus tracing from the adrenal revealed first order labelling in neurons in the intermedio-lateral column of the spinal cord that were shown to receive an input from oxytocin fibres and subsequently second-order labelling in neurons of the autonomic division of the paraventricular nucleus. The latter neurons were shown to receive an input from vasopressin or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) containing SCN efferents. The true character of this SCN input to second-order neurons was also demonstrated by the fact that third-order labelling was present within the SCN, vasopressin or VIP neurons. The functional presence of the SCN-adrenal connection was demonstrated by a light-induced fast decrease in plasma corticosterone that could not be attributed to a decrease in ACTH. Using intact and SCN-lesioned animals, the immediate decrease in plasma corticosterone was only observed in intact animals and only at the beginning of the dark period. This fast decrease of corticosterone was accompanied by constant basal levels of blood adrenaline and noradrenaline, and is proposed to be due to a direct inhibition of the neuronal output to the adrenal cortex by light-mediated activation of SCN neurons. As a consequence, it is proposed that the SCN utilizes neuronal pathways to spread its time of the day message, not only to the pineal, but also to other organs, including the adrenal, utilizing the autonomic nervous system.},

In mammals, the circadian timekeeping system has a complex architecture, composed of a central pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and subsidiary clocks in nearly every body cell. The central clock is synchronized to geophysical time mainly via photic cues perceived by the retina and transmitted by electrical signals to SCN neurons. In turn, the SCN influences circadian physiology and behavior via neuronal and humoral cues and via the synchronization of local oscillators that are operative in the cells of most organs and tissues. Thus, some of the SCN output pathways serve as input pathways for peripheral tissues. Here we discuss knowledge acquired during the past few years on the complex structure and function of the mammalian circadian timing system.},

We found 43\% of all protein coding genes showed circadian rhythms in transcription somewhere in the body, largely in an organ-specific manner. In most organs, we noticed the expression of many oscillating genes peaked during transcriptional "rush hours" preceding dawn and dusk. Looking at the genomic landscape of rhythmic genes, we saw that they clustered together, were longer, and had more spliceforms than nonoscillating genes. Systems-level analysis revealed intricate rhythmic orchestration of gene pathways throughout the body. We also found oscillations in the expression of more than 1,000 known and novel noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Supporting their potential role in mediating clock function, ncRNAs conserved between mouse and human showed rhythmic expression in similar proportions as protein coding genes. Importantly, we also found that the majority of best-selling drugs and World Health Organization essential medicines directly target the products of rhythmic genes. Many of these drugs have short half-lives and may benefit from timed dosage. In sum, this study highlights critical, systemic, and surprising roles of the mammalian circadian clock and provides a blueprint for advancement in chronotherapy.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

  abstract = {The role of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in sleep induction and maintenance is well accepted since most insomnia treatments target GABAa receptors. However, the population(s) of GABAergic neurons involved in the beneficial effect of GABA on sleep remains to be identified. This is not an easy task since GABAergic neurons are widely distributed in all brain structures. A recently growing number of populations of GABAergic neurons have been involved in sleep control. We first review here possible candidates for inducing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep including the GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic area, the parafacial zone in the brainstem, the nucleus accumbens and the cortex. We also discuss the role of several populations of GABAergic neurons in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep control. Indeed, it is well accepted that muscle atonia occurring during REM sleep is due to a GABA/glycinergic hyperpolarization of motoneurons. Recent evidence strongly suggests that these neurons are located in the ventral medullary reticular formation. It has also recently been shown that neurons containing the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone and GABA located in the lateral hypothalamic area control REM sleep expression. Finally, a population of REM-off GABAergic neurons located in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray has been shown to gate REM sleep by inhibiting glutamatergic neurons located in the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In summary, recent data clearly indicate that multiple populations of GABAergic neurons located throughout the brain from the cortex to the medulla oblongata control NREM and REM sleep.},

A further analysis indicated that body movement, after rising to a peak, dropped sharply at the onset of rapid eye movements and rebounded abruptly as the eye movements ceased. Records from a large number of nights in single individuals indicated that some could maintain a very striking regularity in their sleep pattern from night to night. The stage 1 EEG at the onset of sleep was never associated with rapid eye movements and was also characterized by a lower auditory threshold than the later periods of stage 1.

We propose that NREM and REM sleep have distinct and complementary contributions to the overall function of sleep. Specifically, we suggest that cortical slow oscillations, occurring within specific functionally interconnected neuronal networks during NREM sleep, enable information processing, synaptic plasticity, and prophylactic cellular maintenance ("recovery process"). In turn, periodic excursions into an activated brain state-REM sleep-appear to be ideally placed to perform "selection" of brain networks, which have benefited from the process of "recovery," based on their offline performance. Such two-stage modus operandi of the sleep process would ensure that its functions are fulfilled according to the current need and in the shortest time possible. Our hypothesis accounts for the overall architecture of normal sleep and opens up new perspectives for understanding pathological conditions associated with abnormal sleep patterns.},

  abstract = {A commonly held view is that extended wakefulness is causal for a broad spectrum of deleterious effects at molecular, cellular, network, physiological, psychological, and behavioral levels. Consequently, it is often presumed that sleep plays an active role in providing renormalization of the changes incurred during preceding waking. Not surprisingly, unequivocal empirical evidence supporting such a simple bi-directional interaction between waking and sleep is often limited or controversial. One difficulty is that, invariably, a constellation of many intricately interrelated factors, including the time of day, specific activities or behaviors during preceding waking, metabolic status and stress are present at the time of measurement, shaping the overall effect observed. In addition to this, although insufficient or disrupted sleep is thought to prevent efficient recovery of specific physiological variables, it is also often difficult to attribute specific changes to the lack of sleep proper. Furthermore, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by a multitude of processes, whose unique and distinct contributions to the purported functions of sleep are difficult to determine, because they are interrelated. Intensive research effort over the last decades has greatly progressed current understanding of the cellular and physiological processes underlying the regulation of vigilance states. Notably, it also highlighted the infinite complexity within both waking and sleep, and revealed a number of fundamental conceptual and technical obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully understand these processes. A promising approach could be to view sleep not as an entity, which has specific function(s) and is subject to direct regulation, but as a manifestation of the process of metaregulation, which enables efficient moment-to-moment integration between internal and external factors, preceding history and current homeostatic needs.},

  abstract = {Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support.},

  abstract = {Reduced sleep duration and quality appear to be endemic in modern society. Curtailment of the bedtime period to minimum tolerability is thought to be efficient and harmless by many. It has been known for several decades that sleep is a major modulator of hormonal release, glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. In particular, slow wave sleep (SWS), thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, is associated with decreased heart rate, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity and cerebral glucose utilization, compared with wakefulness. During SWS, the anabolic growth hormone is released while the stress hormone cortisol is inhibited. In recent years, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence have converged to indicate that sleep loss may be a novel risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of obesity is possibly linked to the effect of sleep loss on hormones that play a major role in the central control of appetite and energy expenditure, such as leptin and ghrelin. Reduced leptin and increased ghrelin levels correlate with increases in subjective hunger when individuals are sleep restricted rather than well rested. Given the evidence, sleep curtailment appears to be an important, yet modifiable, risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. The marked decrease in average sleep duration in the last 50 years coinciding with the increased prevalence of obesity, together with the observed adverse effects of recurrent partial sleep deprivation on metabolism and hormonal processes, may have important implications for public health.},

  abstract = {Sleep deprivation disrupts vital biological processes that are necessary for cognitive ability and physical health, but the physiological changes that underlie these outward effects are largely unknown. The purpose of the present studies in the laboratory rat is to prolong sleep deprivation to delineate the pathophysiology and to determine its mediation. In the rat, the course of prolonged sleep deprivation has a syndromic nature and eventuates in a life-threatening state. An early and central symptom of sleep deprivation is a progressive increase in peripheral energy expenditure to nearly double normal levels. An attempt to alleviate this negative energy balance by feeding rats a balanced diet that is high in its efficiency of utilization prolongs survival and attenuates or delays development of malnutrition-like symptoms, indicating that several symptoms can be manipulated to some extent by energy and nutrient consumption. Most changes in neuroendocrine parameters appear to be responses to metabolic demands, such as increased plasma catecholamines indicating sympathetic activation. Plasma total thyroid hormones, however, decline to severely low levels; a metabolic complication that is associated with other sleep deprivation-induced symptoms, such as a decline in body temperature to hypothermic levels despite increased energy expenditure. Metabolic mapping of the brain revealed a dissociation between the energy metabolism of the brain and that of the body. Sleep deprivation's effects on cerebral structures are heterogeneous and unidirectional toward decreased functional activity. The hypometabolic brain structures are concentrated in the hypothalamus, thalamus and limbic systems, whereas few regions in the rest of the brain and none in the medulla, are affected. Correspondence can be found between some of the affected cerebral structures and several of the peripheral symptoms, such as hyperphagia and possible heat retention problems. The factor predisposing to mortality is a decreased resistance to infection. Lethal opportunistic organisms are permitted to infect the bloodstream, which presumably results in a cascade of toxic-like reactions. Host defense is thus the first system to fail. There is neither fever nor marked tissue inflammatory reactions typical of infectious disease states, suggesting that sleep deprivation is immunosuppressive. Each of the four abnormalities identified--(1) a deep negative energy balance and associated malnutrition; (2) heterogeneous decreases in cerebral function; (3) low thyroid hormone concentrations; and (4) decrease resistance to infection--can be viewed as having an early origin during the sleep deprivation process to signify the foremost pathogenic situation to which the other abnormalities might be secondarily related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {A model for the timing of human sleep is presented. It is based on a sleep-regulating variable (S)--possibly, but not necessarily, associated with a neurochemical substance--which increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Sleep onset is triggered when S approaches an upper threshold (H); awakening occurs when S reaches a lower threshold (L). The thresholds show a circadian rhythm controlled by a single circadian pacemaker. Time constants of the S process were derived from rates of change of electroencephalographic (EEG) power density during regular sleep and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The waveform of the circadian threshold fluctuations was derived from spontaneous wake-up times after partial sleep deprivation. The model allows computer simulations of the main phenomena of human sleep timing, such as 1) internal desynchronization in the absence of time cues, 2) sleep fragmentation during continuous bed rest, and 3) circadian phase dependence of sleep duration during isolation from time cues, recovery from sleep deprivation, and shift work. The model shows that the experimental data are consistent with the concept of a single circadian pacemaker in humans. It has implications for the understanding of sleep as a restorative process and its timing with respect to day and night.},

  issn = {1529-2401},
  abstract = {Delta power, a measure of EEG activity in the 1-4 Hz range, in slow-wave sleep (SWS) is in a quantitative and predictive relationship with prior wakefulness. Thus, sleep loss evokes a proportional increase in delta power, and excess sleep a decrease. Therefore, delta power is thought to reflect SWS need and its underlying homeostatically regulated recovery process. The neurophysiological substrate of this process is unknown and forward genetics might help elucidate the nature of what is depleted during wakefulness and recovered during SWS. We applied a mathematical method that quantifies the relationship between the sleep-wake distribution and delta power to sleep data of six inbred mouse strains. The results demonstrated that the rate at which SWS need accumulated varied greatly with genotype. This conclusion was confirmed in a "dose-response" study of sleep loss and changes in delta power; delta power strongly depended on both the duration of prior wakefulness and genotype. We followed the segregation of the rebound of delta power after sleep deprivation in 25 BXD recombinant inbred strains by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. One "significant" QTL was identified on chromosome 13 that accounted for 49\% of the genetic variance in this trait. Interestingly, the rate at which SWS need decreases did not vary with genotype in any of the 31 inbred strains studied. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that the increase of SWS need is under a strong genetic control, and they provide a basis for identifying genes underlying SWS homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Increasing sleep pressure is associated with highly predictable changes in the dynamics of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). To investigate whether the effects of reduced sleep pressure also can be accounted for by homeostatic mechanisms, nighttime sleep following an evening nap was recorded in healthy young men. In comparison with the baseline night, sleep latency in the postnap night was prolonged, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) latency was reduced, and EEG power density in non-REMS was decreased in the delta and theta band. The buildup of both EEG slow-wave activity (SWA; power density in the 0.75-to 4.5-Hz range) and spindle frequency activity (SFA; power density in the 12.25-to 15.0-Hz range) in non-REMS episodes was diminished (SWA: episodes 1-3; SFA: episode 1). The typical declining trend of SWA over consecutive non-REM sleep episodes was attenuated. The time course of SWA could be closely simulated with a homeostatic model of sleep regulation, although some discrepancies in level and buildup of SWA were apparent. We conclude that homeostatic mechanisms can largely account for the dynamics of the sleep EEG under conditions of reduced sleep pressure.},

The search of regulatory factors has identified a number of potential molecules that increase their concentration in waking and decrease it during sleep. These factors regulate many physiological functions, including energy metabolism, neural plasticity and immune functions and one molecule may participate in the regulation of all these functions. The method to study regulation of sleep homeostasis is experimental prolongation of waking, which is used also to address the question of physiological purpose of sleep: prolonging wakefulness provokes symptoms that tell us what goes wrong during lack of sleep. The interpretation of the role of each identified factor in the regulation of sleep/sleep homeostasis reflects the theoretical background concept of the research. Presently three main concepts are being actively studied: the energy (depletion) hypothesis, the neural plasticity hypothesis and the (immune) defense hypothesis.},

Here, we summarize evidence that adenosinergic mechanisms regulate not only the dynamic of sleep pressure, but are also implicated in the interaction of homeostatic and circadian processes. We review how this interaction becomes evident at several levels, including electrophysiological data, neuroimaging studies and behavioral observations. Regarding complex human behavior, we particularly focus on sleep-wake regulatory influences on working memory performance and underlying brain activity, with a specific emphasis on the role of adenosine in this interplay.

One group of lesioned rats was run in constant dim light. Another lesioned group and an intact group were run on a 12:12 dark-light schedule with TSD and recovery beginning at lights-off. All groups showed immediate rebounds of high-amplitude NREM sleep and paradoxical sleep, confined mostly to the first 12-18 h of recovery, and decreases in moderate and low-amplitude NREM sleep during the first 6-12 h of recovery. Thus, sleep stage rebound priorities were little affected by CRs. Total sleep rebound was initially greatest in intact rats, but limited mostly to the first 12 h of recovery. Total sleep rebound was distributed over a longer period in SCN rats, but total accumulated rebound was similar in all groups. Thus, CRs appear to modulate the timing but not the amount of accumulated total sleep rebound. Results were interpreted in terms of ceiling effects on total sleep, delayed rebounds, and competition between CRs and homeostatic recovery processes. Recovery sleep of lesioned rats on the dark-light schedule was marked by a transient diurnal rhythm.},

  abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram of rats with lesions in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNx) were recorded during two series of 24-h baseline, 6-h sleep deprivation (SD), and 24-h recovery. At recovery onset, rats were injected i.p. with vehicle (VEH) control solution or 0.4 mg/kg triazolam (TRZ) in a balanced crossover design. Consecutive 10-s epochs were scored for vigilance states and EEG power spectra were computed. Arousal states were uniformly distributed during 24-h baseline (wake 47\% of recording time, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (nonREMS) 47\%, REMS 7\%), and EEG spectra (0-25 Hz) were devoid of significant trends. State-specific EEG power spectra profiles in SCNx rats were similar to those of intact animals reported previously. However, EEG delta power (0.5-3.5 Hz) of nonREMS was markedly lower in SCNx rats. Recovery from 6-h SD was characterised by a short-lasting reduction of REMS, and a long-lasting increase of nonREMS time at the cost of wakefulness. EEG delta power rebounded during the first 8 h in recovery, and fell below baseline level after 12 h in recovery. During 0-2 h TRZ recovery, rats spent more time in nonREMS with higher EEG slow wave activity as compared to the corresponding VEH recovery period. EEG slow wave activity fell below baseline levels 10 h after TRZ injection and termination of SD. We conclude that major features of homeostatic sleep EEG regulation are present in SCNx rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Sleep and wakefulness are governed by both the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN), and a sleep homeostatic process; however, the interaction of these control systems is not well understood. From rodent studies it has been assumed that the SCN promote neither wake nor sleep but gate the homeostatic sleep-promoting process. Yet in humans sleep tendency is lowest during the later waking hours of the day, and sleep duration can be predicted because of the precise circadian timing of waking. Thus in primates, the SCN could assure sleep-wake cycle consolidation by actively promoting or facilitating wakefulness. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the sleep-wake and sleep-stage patterns of intact and SCN-lesioned (SCNx) squirrel monkeys maintained in constant light. This diurnal primate has consolidated sleep and wake patterns more similar to man than rodents. Sleep-wake, sleep stages, brain temperature, and drinking circadian rhythms were eliminated, and total sleep time was significantly increased (4.0 hr, P {$<$} 0.01) in SCNx monkeys. However, total times in deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; e.g., delta sleep) and REM sleep were not significantly affected by SCN lesions. Increased total sleep time was associated with a reduction in subjective day wake consolidation, as evidenced by substantially shorter wake bout lengths in SCNx monkeys (15 +/- 6 min) as compared to intact monkeys (223 +/- 10 min; P {$<$} 0.0001, ANOVA). These findings show that the SCN influence the regulation of daily total wake and sleep times, and implicate an alternative sleep-wake regulatory model in which an SCN-dependent process actively facilitates the initiation and maintenance of wakefulness and opposes homeostatic sleep tendency during the subjective day in diurnal primates.},

Much of what we know about this system is based on experimental protocols that induce the desynchronization of behavioral and physiological rhythms within individual subjects, but the neural (or extraneural) substrates for such desynchronization are unknown. We have developed an animal model of human internal desynchrony in which rats are exposed to artificially short (22-h) light-dark cycles. Under these conditions, locomotor activity, sleep-wake, and slow-wave sleep (SWS) exhibit two rhythms within individual animals, one entrained to the 22-h light-dark cycle and the other free-running with a period {$>$}24 h (tau({$>$}24 h)). Whereas core body temperature showed two rhythms as well, further analysis indicates this variable oscillates more according to the tau({$>$}24 h) rhythm than to the 22-h rhythm, and that this oscillation is due to an activity-independent circadian regulation. Paradoxical sleep (PS), on the other hand, shows only one free-running rhythm. Our results show that, similarly to humans, (i) circadian rhythms can be internally dissociated in a controlled and predictable manner in the rat and (ii) the circadian rhythms of sleep-wake and SWS can be desynchronized from the rhythms of PS and core body temperature within individual animals. This model now allows for a deeper understanding of the human timekeeping mechanism, for testing potential therapies for circadian dysrhythmias, and for studying the biology of PS and SWS states in a neurologically intact model.},

  abstract = {Sleep is consistently concentrated to a specific time of the day. Its timing and consolidation depend on the interplay between a homeostatic and a circadian process of sleep regulation [1-3]. Sleep propensity rises as a homeostatic response to increasing wake time, whereas a circadian clock determines the specific time when sleep will probably occur. This two-process regulation of sleep also determines which specific sleep stage will be manifested, and the circadian process governs tightly the manifestation of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) [1, 4]. The role of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the circadian gating of sleep and wakefulness has been unequivocally established by lesion studies [5], but its role in the timing of specific sleep stages has remained unknown. Using a forced desynchrony paradigm that induces the stable dissociation of the ventrolateral (vl) and dorsomedial (dm) SCN, and a jetlag paradigm that induces desynchronization between these SCN subregions, we show that the SCN can time the occurrence of specific sleep stages. Specifically, the circadian regulation of REMS is associated with clock gene expression within the dmSCN. We provide the first neurophysiological model for the disruption of sleep architecture that may result from temporal challenges such as rotational-shift work and jetlag.},

Double-labeling experiments revealed several possible links between the SCN and the LC, including the dorsomedial (DMH) and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN), as well as medial and ventrolateral pre-optic areas. Lesion studies confirmed that the DMH is a substantial relay in this circuit. Next, neurophysiology experiments revealed circadian variations in LC impulse activity. Lesions of the DMH eliminated these circadian changes in LC activity, confirming the functionality of the SCN-DMH-LC circuit.

  shorttitle = {Circadian Regulation of Arousal},
  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons regulate arousal. Previous studies have shown that noradrenergic LC neurons exhibit a circadian rhythm in impulse activity, which peaks during the active period. This is mediated by an indirect circuit projection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the LC. Here we sought to evaluate the hypothesis that the LC regulates the circadian properties of the sleep-wake cycle.
DESIGN: Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a light-dark (LD) schedule or in constant darkness (DD) for 3 to 4 weeks were treated with DSP-4, a neurotoxic agent specific for noradrenergic-LC projections. Vigilance states were analyzed before and 3 weeks after LC lesion. The DSP-4 lesion was verified by immunohistochemistry of noradrenergic fibers in the frontal cortex.
SETTING: University of Pennsylvania.
PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: N/A.
INTERVENTIONS: N/A.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: DSP-4 decreased the amplitude of the sleep-wake rhythm in LD animals by significantly decreasing wakefulness and increasing sleep during the active period. However, DSP-4 had no effect on the sleep-wake cycle of DD animals. Moreover, DD itself decreased the amplitude of the sleep-wake cycle similar to that of the neurotoxic lesion of the noradrenergic system in LD animals. Analysis of noradrenergic fiber staining in the frontal cortex revealed that this effect was associated with fewer fibers or boutons in nonlesioned DD rats than in nonlesioned LD animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Noradrenergic LC neurons provide a circadian regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, and the maintenance of LC function depends on light exposure. Light deprivation induces a loss of noradrenergic fibers, which in turn decreases the amplitude of the sleep-wake rhythm.},

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian pacemaker for the brain, provides a massive projection to the subparaventricular zone (SPZ), but the role of the SPZ in circadian processes has received little attention. We examined the effects on circadian rhythms of sleep, body temperature, and activity in rats of restricted ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral or dorsal SPZ that spared the immediately adjacent paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) and the SCN. Ventral SPZ lesions caused profound reduction of measures of circadian index of sleep (by 90\%) and locomotor activity (75\% reduction) but had less effect on body temperature (50\% reduction); dorsal SPZ lesions caused greater reduction of circadian index of body temperature (by 70\%) but had less effect on circadian index of locomotor activity (45\% reduction) or sleep ({$<$}5\% reduction). The loss of circadian regulation of body temperature or sleep was replaced by a strong ultradian rhythm (period approximately 3 hr). Lesions of the PVH, immediately dorsal to the SPZ, had no significant effect on any circadian rhythms that we measured, nor did the lesions affect the baseline body temperature. However, the fever response after intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (5 microg/kg) was markedly decreased in the rats with PVH lesions (66.6\%) but not dorsal SPZ lesions. These results indicate that circadian rhythms of sleep and body temperatures are regulated by separate neuronal populations in the SPZ, and different aspects of thermoregulation (circadian rhythm and fever response) are controlled by distinct anatomical substrates.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {0161-8105},
  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that albino but not pigmented rats show acute increases in REM sleep following light-to-dark transitions. Light and dark have also been shown to have direct effects on NREM sleep and wakefulness in albino rats. Little is known, however, about the direct light-dark effects on sleep patterns in pigmented animals. The purpose of the present study was to compare the direct effects of light and dark on REM sleep, NREM sleep, and waking in albino Lewis and pigmented Brown Norway (BN) rats.
DESIGN: Groups of albino Lewis and pigmented Brown Norway (BN) rats were exposed to various light-dark (LD) schedules. In the first experiment, the lighting schedules were LD 12:12 and LD 3:3. The second experiment compared LD 12:12 with an irregular schedule consisting of short light and dark periods of unequal length.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Both Lewis and BN rats slept more during the light and were awake more during the dark on all schedules. REM sleep patterns in light and dark periods were opposite, however. Lewis rats spent more of their sleep in REM sleep during dark than the light, whereas BN rats had a higher proportion of REM sleep in the light.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there are substantial direct effects of light and dark on sleep in pigmented as well as in albino rats, although these effects are not always the same in magnitude or even in direction.},

  abstract = {Light detected in the retina modulates several physiological processes including circadian photo-entrainment and pupillary light reflex. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) convey rod-cone and melanopsin-driven light input to the brain. Using EEGs and electromyograms, we show that acute light induces sleep in mice during their nocturnal active phase whereas acute dark awakens mice during their diurnal sleep phase. We used retinal mutant mouse lines that lack (i) the ipRGCs, (ii) the photo-transduction pathways of rods and cones, or (iii) the melanopsin protein and showed that the influence of light and dark on sleep requires both rod-cone and melanopsin signaling through ipRGCs and is independent of image formation. We further show that, although acute light pulses overcome circadian and homeostatic drives for sleep, upon repeated light exposures using a 3.5 h/3.5 h light/dark cycle, the circadian and homeostatic drives override the light input. Thus, in addition to their known role in aligning circadian physiology with day and night, ipRGCs also relay light and dark information from both rod-cone and melanopsin-based pathways to modulate sleep and wakefulness.},

However, in the absence of a circadian clock, overall sleep-wake rhythmicity is preserved and remains synchronized to the external light-dark cycle, indicating that there is an additional, clock-independent photic input to sleep. We found that the direct photic regulation of sleep in mice is predominantly mediated by melanopsin (OPN4)-based photoreception of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Moreover, OPN4-dependent sleep regulation was correlated with the activation of sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area and the superior colliculus. Collectively, our findings describe a previously unknown pathway in sleep regulation and identify the pRGC/OPN4 signaling system as a potentially new pharmacological target for the selective manipulation of sleep and arousal states.},

In the present study, we investigated this direct effect of light on various sleep parameters by exposing mice to a broad range of illuminances (0.2-200 μW/cm(2) ; equivalent to 1-1000 lux) for 1 h during the dark phase (zeitgeber time 13-14). Fitting the data with a three-parameter log model indicated that \textasciitilde{}0.1 μW/cm(2) can generate half the sleep response observed at 200 μW/cm(2). We observed decreases in total sleep time during the 1 h following the end of the light pulse. Light reduced the latency to sleep from \textasciitilde{}30 min in darkness (baseline) to \textasciitilde{}10 min at the highest intensity, although this effect was invariant across the light intensities used. We then assessed the role of melanopsin during the rapid transition from wakefulness to sleep at the onset of a light pulse and the maintenance of sleep with a 6-h 20 μW/cm(2) light pulse. Even though the melanopsin knockout mice had robust induction of sleep (\textasciitilde{}35 min) during the first hour of the pulse, it was not maintained. Total sleep decreased by almost 65\% by the third hour in comparison with the first hour of the pulse in mice lacking melanopsin, whereas only an 8\% decrease was observed in wild-type mice. Collectively, our findings highlight the selective effects of light on murine sleep, and suggest that melanopsin-based photoreception is primarily involved in sustaining light-induced sleep.},

Moreover, this gene expression accompanies the surge of plasma and brain corticosterone levels without accompanying activation of the hypothalamo-adenohypophysial axis. The abolishment after SCN lesioning, and the day-night difference of light-induced adrenal gene expression and corticosterone release, clearly indicate that this phenomenon is closely linked to the circadian clock.

The occurrence of EEG slow-wave activity has served as a measure for sleep intensity. The capacity to sleep more intensely enables animals to react more flexibly to sleep loss.

  abstract = {The brain's master circadian pacemaker resides within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN clock neurons are entrained to the day/night cycle via the retinohypothalamic tract and the SCN provides temporal information to the central nervous system and to peripheral organs that function as secondary oscillators. The SCN clock-cell network is thought to be the hypothalamic link between the retina and descending autonomic circuits to peripheral organs such as the adrenal gland, thereby entraining those organs to the day/night cycle. However, there are at least three different routes or mechanisms by which retinal signals transmitted to the hypothalamus may be conveyed to peripheral organs: 1) via retinal input to SCN clock neurons; 2) via retinal input to non-clock neurons in the SCN; or 3) via retinal input to hypothalamic regions neighboring the SCN. It is very well documented that light-induced responses of the SCN clock (i.e., clock gene expression, neural activity, and behavioral phase shifts) occur primarily during the subjective night. Thus to determine the role of the SCN clock in transmitting photic signals to descending autonomic circuits, we compared the phase dependency of light-evoked responses in the SCN and a peripheral oscillator, the adrenal gland. We observed light-evoked clock gene expression in the mouse adrenal throughout the subjective day and subjective night. Light also induced adrenal corticosterone secretion during both the subjective day and subjective night. The irradiance threshold for light-evoked adrenal responses was greater during the subjective day compared to the subjective night. These results suggest that retinohypothalamic signals may be relayed to the adrenal clock during the subjective day by a retinal pathway or cellular mechanism that is independent of an effect of light on the SCN neural clock network and thus may be important for the temporal integration of physiology and metabolism.},

  abstract = {Light plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous aspects of physiology and behaviour, including the entrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of sleep. These responses involve melanopsin (OPN4)-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) in addition to rods and cones. Nocturnal light exposure in rodents has been shown to result in rapid sleep induction, in which melanopsin plays a key role. However, studies have also shown that light exposure can result in elevated corticosterone, a response that is not compatible with sleep. To investigate these contradictory findings and to dissect the relative contribution of pRGCs and rods/cones, we assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep. Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4-/-), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. We go on to show that blue light evokes higher Fos induction in the SCN compared to the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), whereas green light produced greater responses in the VLPO. Collectively, our data demonstrates that nocturnal light exposure can have either an arousal- or sleep-promoting effect, and that these responses are melanopsin-mediated via different neural pathways with different spectral sensitivities. These findings raise important questions relating to how artificial light may alter behaviour in both the work and domestic setting.},

Indirect evidence links these events to light detection by intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) [1-9]. However, there is currently no direct demonstration that mRGCs can have such an immediate effect on mood or behavioral state in any species. We addressed this deficit by using chemogenetics to selectively activate mRGCs, simulating the excitatory effects of bright light on this cell type~in dark-housed mice. This specific manipulation evoked circadian phase resetting and pupil constriction (known consequences of mRGC activation). It also induced c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) in multiple nuclei in the hypothalamus (paraventricular, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamus), thalamus (paraventricular and centromedian thalamus), and limbic system (amygdala and nucleus accumbens). These regions influence numerous aspects of autonomic and neuroendocrine activity and are typically active during periods~of wakefulness or arousal. By contrast, c-Fos was absent from the ventrolateral preoptic area (active during sleep). In standard behavioral tests (open field and elevated plus maze), mRGC activation induced behaviors commonly interpreted as anxiety like or as signs of increased alertness. Similar changes in behavior could be induced by bright light in wild-type and rodless and coneless mice, but not melanopsin knockout mice. These data demonstrate that mRGCs drive a light-dependent switch in behavioral motivation toward a more alert, risk-averse state. They also highlight the ability of this small fraction of retinal ganglion cells to realign activity in brain regions defining widespread aspects of physiology and behavior.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In bright light, mammals use a distinct photopigment (melanopsin) to measure irradiance for centrally mediated responses such as circadian entrainment. We aimed to determine whether the information generated by melanopsin is also used by the visual system as a signal for light adaptation. To this end, we compared retinal and thalamic responses to a range of artificial and natural visual stimuli presented using spectral compositions that either approximate the mouse's experience of natural daylight ("daylight") or are selectively depleted of wavelengths to which melanopsin is most sensitive ("mel-low").
RESULTS: We found reproducible and reversible changes in the flash electroretinogram between daylight and mel-low. Simultaneous recording in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) revealed that these reflect changes in feature selectivity of visual circuits in both temporal and spatial dimensions. A substantial fraction of units preferred finer spatial patterns in the daylight condition, while the population of direction-sensitive units became tuned to faster motion. The dLGN contained a richer, more reliable encoding of natural scenes in the daylight condition. These effects were absent in mice lacking melanopsin.
CONCLUSIONS: The feature selectivity of many neurons in the mouse dLGN is adjusted according to a melanopsin-dependent measure of environmental brightness. These changes originate, at least in part, within the retina. Melanopsin performs a role analogous to a photographer's light meter, providing an independent measure of irradiance that determines optimal setting for visual circuits.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms optimize physiology and behavior to the varying demands of the 24 h day. The master circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and it regulates circadian oscillators in tissues throughout the body to prevent internal desynchrony. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that, under standard 12 h:12 h light/dark (LD) cycles, object, visuospatial, and olfactory recognition performance in C57BL/6J mice is consistently better at midday relative to midnight. However, under repeated exposure to constant light (rLL), recognition performance becomes desynchronized, with object and visuospatial performance better at subjective midday and olfactory performance better at subjective midnight. This desynchrony in behavioral performance is mirrored by changes in expression of the canonical clock genes Period1 and Period2 (Per1 and Per2), as well as the immediate-early gene Fos in the SCN, dorsal hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Under rLL, rhythmic Per1 and Fos expression is attenuated in the SCN. In contrast, hippocampal gene expression remains rhythmic, mirroring object and visuospatial performance. Strikingly, Per1 and Fos expression in the olfactory bulb is reversed, mirroring the inverted olfactory performance. Temporal desynchrony among these regions does not result in arrhythmicity because core body temperature and exploratory activity rhythms persist under rLL. Our data provide the first demonstration that abnormal lighting conditions can give rise to temporal desynchrony between autonomous circadian oscillators in different regions, with different consequences for performance across different sensory domains. Such a dispersed network of dissociable circadian oscillators may provide greater flexibility when faced with conflicting environmental signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus regulates physiology and behavior across the 24 h day by synchronizing peripheral clocks throughout the brain and body. Without the SCN, these peripheral clocks rapidly become desynchronized. Here, we provide a unique demonstration that, under lighting conditions in which the central clock in the SCN is dampened, peripheral oscillators in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb become desynchronized, along with the behavioral processes mediated by these clocks. Multiple clocks that adopt different phase relationships may enable processes occurring in different brain regions to be optimized to specific phases of the 24 h day. Moreover, such a dispersed network of dissociable circadian clocks may provide greater flexibility when faced with conflicting environmental signals (e.g., seasonal changes in photoperiod).},

  abstract = {The rod and cone photoreceptors that mediate visual phototransduction in mammals are not required for light-induced circadian entrainment, negative masking of locomotor activity, suppression of pineal melatonin, or the pupillary light reflex. The photopigment melanopsin has recently been identified in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), and olivary pretectal nucleus, suggesting that melanopsin might influence a variety of irradiance-driven responses. We have found novel projections from RGCs that express melanopsin mRNA to the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), a region involved in circadian regulation and negative masking, and the sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and determined the subsets of melanopsin-expressing RGCs that project to the SCN, the pretectal area (PTA), and the IGL division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Melanopsin was expressed in the majority of RGCs that project to the SCN, vSPZ, and VLPO and in a subpopulation of RGCs that innervate the PTA and the IGL but not in RGCs projecting to the dorsal LGN or superior colliculus. Two-thirds of RGCs containing melanopsin transcript projected to each of the SCN and contralateral PTA, and one-fifth projected to the ipsilateral IGL. Double-retrograde tracing from the SCN and PTA demonstrated a subpopulation of RGCs projecting to both sites, most of which contained melanopsin mRNA. Our results suggest that melanopsin expression defines a subset of RGCs that play a broad role in the regulation of nonvisual photoreception, providing collateralized projections that contribute to circadian entrainment, negative masking, the regulation of sleep-wake states, and the pupillary light reflex.},

  abstract = {Light-dark periodicity and luminance play important roles in regulating sleep-wake cycles. We recently identified a discrete cluster of sleep-active cells in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus that we hypothesize plays a central role in sleep regulation. These ventrolateral preoptic nucleus neurons are GABAergic and galaninergic and innervate the monoaminergic cell groups that contribute to the ascending arousal system. To determine whether there are retinal inputs to sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic nucleus neurons, we injected 5 microl of 1\% cholera toxin B subunit into one eye in a series of rats. We found anterogradely labeled axons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus bilaterally, with a contralateral predominance. Using Fos to identify sleep-active neurons, we found that the cholera toxin B subunit-labeled retinal fibers gave rise to terminals that were distributed among the Fos-positive, sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic nucleus neurons. Combining cholera toxin B subunit staining with galanin immunoreactivity, we found that the retinal terminals formed appositions with the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of galaninergic ventrolateral preoptic nucleus neurons. Following Fluorogold injection into the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus region, we found retrogradely labeled neurons in the superior part of the peripheral retina contralateral to the injection site and in the superior temporal quadrant of the peripheral retina ipsilateral to the injection site. The size of labeled retinal ganglion cells suggested that they belonged to the type III or W type, which provide luminance input, e.g., to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The retinal projection to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus may provide an anatomical substrate by which luminance levels may directly influence sleep.},

  abstract = {Sleep inertia, sleep homeostatic and circadian processes modulate cognition, including reaction time, memory, mood and alertness. How these processes influence higher-order cognitive functions is not well known. Six participants completed a 73-day-long study that included two 14-day-long 28-h forced desynchrony protocols to examine separate and interacting influences of sleep inertia, sleep homeostasis and circadian phase on higher-order cognitive functions of inhibitory control and selective visual attention. Cognitive performance for most measures was impaired immediately after scheduled awakening and improved during the first \textasciitilde{}2-4~h of wakefulness (decreasing sleep inertia); worsened thereafter until scheduled bedtime (increasing sleep homeostasis); and was worst at \textasciitilde{}60° and best at \textasciitilde{}240° (circadian modulation, with worst and best phases corresponding to \textasciitilde{}09:00 and \textasciitilde{}21:00~hours, respectively, in individuals with a habitual wake time of 07:00~hours). The relative influences of sleep inertia, sleep homeostasis and circadian phase depended on the specific higher-order cognitive function task examined. Inhibitory control appeared to be modulated most strongly by circadian phase, whereas selective visual attention for a spatial-configuration search task was modulated most strongly by sleep inertia. These findings demonstrate that some higher-order cognitive processes are differentially sensitive to different sleep-wake regulatory processes. Differential modulation of cognitive functions by different sleep-wake regulatory processes has important implications for understanding mechanisms contributing to performance impairments during adverse circadian phases, sleep deprivation and/or upon awakening from sleep.},

  abstract = {Cognitive and affective processes vary over the course of the 24 h day. Time of day dependent changes in human cognition are modulated by an internal circadian timekeeping system with a near-24 h period. The human circadian timekeeping system interacts with sleep-wakefulness regulatory processes to modulate brain arousal, neurocognitive and affective function. Brain arousal is regulated by ascending brain stem, basal forebrain (BF) and hypothalamic arousal systems and inhibition or disruption of these systems reduces brain arousal, impairs cognition, and promotes sleep. The internal circadian timekeeping system modulates cognition and affective function by projections from the master circadian clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), to arousal and sleep systems and via clock gene oscillations in brain tissues. Understanding the basic principles of circadian and wakefulness-sleep physiology can help to recognize how the circadian system modulates human cognition and influences learning, memory and emotion. Developmental changes in sleep and circadian processes and circadian misalignment in circadian rhythm sleep disorders have important implications for learning, memory and emotion. Overall, when wakefulness occurs at appropriate internal biological times, circadian clockwork benefits human cognitive and emotion function throughout the lifespan. Yet, when wakefulness occurs at inappropriate biological times because of environmental pressures (e.g., early school start times, long work hours that include work at night, shift work, jet lag) or because of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, the resulting misalignment between circadian and wakefulness-sleep physiology leads to impaired cognitive performance, learning, emotion, and safety.},

Wheel-running activity was measured continuously as a marker of circadian phase. To minimize possible masking effects on performance, animals were placed in constant dim light the day before testing and tested in similar light conditions. Three experiments were run, each of them using animals varying in their previous experience in the water maze. Half of the animals of each experiment were tested 2 to 3 h after activity onset (active group), and the other half were tested 14 to 15 h after activity onset (inactive group). In the three experiments, a significant phase effect was observed in the animals' performance in the water maze; animals tested in the active phase showed steeper acquisition curves. These phase effects on performance are due to the animals' search pattern and not to a better acquisition and maintenance of spatial information; rats tested in the inactive phase found the platform faster on the first trial of the test, when the information on the location of the platform had not been presented to the animals. This effect vanished as the amount of training in the pool increased. Finally, swimming speed also showed a temporal effect, suggesting the existence of a phase effect for motivation to escape from the water; rats tested during their inactive phase tended to swim faster. All together, the data suggest a modulating effect of the biological clock on performance in the water maze, particularly when the animals are less experienced.},

These experiments tested whether rats trained outside their endogenous active period demonstrate the same rate of acquisition, daily performance, and remote memory ability as their nocturnally trained counterparts in tasks of sustained attention and spatial memory. Furthermore, we explored how daily task training influenced circadian patterns of activity. We found that rats demonstrate better acquisition and performance on an operant task requiring attentional effort when trained during the dark-phase. Time of day did not affect acquisition or performance on the Morris water maze; however, when animals were retested 2 wk after their last day of training, they showed better remote memory if training originally occurred during the dark-phase. Finally, attentional, but not spatial, task performance during the light-phase promotes a shift toward diurnality and the synchronization of activity to the time of daily training; this shift was most robust when the demands on the cognitive control of attention were highest. Our findings support a theory of bidirectional interactions between cognitive performance and circadian processes and are consistent with the view that the circadian abnormalities associated with shift-work, aging, and neuropsychiatric illnesses may contribute to the deleterious effects on cognition often present in these populations. Furthermore, these findings suggest that time of day should be an important consideration for a variety of cognitive tasks principally used in psychological and neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {Animals and humans are able to predict and synchronize their daily activity to signals present in their environments. Environmental cues are most often associated with signaling the beginning or the end of a daily activity cycle, but they can also be used to time the presentation or availability of scarce resources. If the signal occurs consistently, animals can begin to anticipate its arrival and ultimately become entrained to its presence. While many stimuli can produce anticipation for a daily event, these events rarely lead to changes in activity patterns during the rest of the circadian cycle. Here the authors demonstrate that performance of a task requiring sustained attention not only produces entrainment, but produces a robust modification in the animals' activity throughout the entire circadian cycle. In particular, normally nocturnal rats, when trained during the light phase (ZT 4) adopted a significant and reversible diurnal activity pattern. Of importance, control experiments demonstrated that this entrainment could not be attributed to the noncognitive components of task performance, such as handling, water deprivation, access to water used as a reward, or animal activity associated with operant training. These findings additionally indicate that levels of cognitive performance are modulated by the circadian cycle and that such activity can act as a highly effective entrainment signal. These results form the basis for future research on the role of neuronal systems mediating interactions between cognitive activity and circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {Endogenous processes referred to as circadian oscillators generate many of the daily rhythms in physiology and behavior of a variety of animals including humans. We investigated the possible circadian regulation of acquisition, recall and extinction in two strains of mice (C-57/6J and C-3H). Mice were trained in either the day or night with a tone and context fear conditioning protocol. The mice were then tested over the course of several days for their ability to recall the training. When comparing the performance of animals in the day and night, the mice acquired the conditioning faster in the day than in the night. Furthermore, the recall for context and tone consistently peaked during the day for at least 3 days after training, irrespective of the time of training. Finally, the loss of this training (or extinction) exhibited a rhythm in that mice trained in night exhibited a greater degree of extinction than mice trained in the day. For all of these rhythms in acquisition, recall, and extinction the phase of the rhythm was controlled by the prior light-dark (LD) cycle. When we reversed the phase of the LD cycle, the phase of the rhythm also reversed. Importantly, all three of the rhythms also continued in constant darkness demonstrating the endogenous, and presumably circadian nature, of the rhythms.},

  abstract = {In species ranging from flies to mammals, parameters of memory processing, like acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval are clearly molded by time of day. However, mechanisms that regulate and adapt these temporal differences are elusive, with an involvement of clock genes and their protein products suggestive. Therefore, we analyzed initially in mouse hippocampus the daytime-dependent dynamics of parameters, known to be important for proper memory formation, like phosphorylation of the "memory molecule" cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responsive element binding protein (CREB) and chromatin remodeling. Next, in an effort to characterize the mechanistic role of clock genes within hippocampal molecular dynamics, we compared the results obtained from wildtype (WT) -mice and mice deficient for the archetypical clock gene Period1 (Per1(-/-) -mice). We detected that the circadian rhythm of CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus of WT mice disappeared completely in mice lacking Per1. Furthermore, we found that the here for the first time described profound endogenous day/night rhythms in histone modifications in the hippocampus of WT-mice are markedly perturbed in Per1(-/-) -mice. Concomitantly, both, in vivo recorded LTP, a cellular correlate for long-term memory, and hippocampal gene expression were significantly altered in the absence of Per1. Notably, these molecular perturbations in Per1(-/-) -mice were accompanied by the loss of daytime-dependent differences in spatial working memory performance. Our data provide a molecular blueprint for a novel role of PER1 in temporally shaping the daytime-dependency of memory performance, likely, by gating CREB signaling, and by coupling to downstream chromatin remodeling.},

In humans, evidence for melanopsin involvement in light-driven cognitive stimulation remains indirect, due to the difficulty to selectively isolate its contribution. Therefore, a role for melanopsin in human cognitive regulation remains to be established. Here, sixteen participants underwent consecutive and identical functional MRI recordings, during which they performed a simple auditory detection task and a more difficult auditory working memory task, while continuously exposed to the same test light (515 nm). We show that the impact of test light on executive brain responses depends on the wavelength of the light to which individuals were exposed prior to each recording. Test-light impact on executive responses in widespread prefrontal areas and in the pulvinar increased when the participants had been exposed to longer (589 nm), but not shorter (461 nm), wavelength light, more than 1 h before. This wavelength-dependent impact of prior light exposure is consistent with recent theories of the light-driven melanopsin dual states. Our results emphasize the critical role of light for cognitive brain responses and are, to date, the strongest evidence in favor of a cognitive role for melanopsin, which may confer a form of "photic memory" to human cognitive brain function.},

The latter information induces non-image-forming responses and exerts powerful effects on physiology such as synchronization of the circadian clock and suppression of melatonin. In rodents, irradiance information is transduced from a discrete subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells via the retinohypothalamic tract to various hypothalamic and brainstem regulatory structures including the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the master circadian pacemaker. In humans, light also acutely modulates alertness, but the cerebral correlates of this effect are unknown. We assessed regional cerebral blood flow in 13 subjects attending to auditory and visual stimuli in near darkness following light exposures ({$>$}8000 lux) of different durations (0.5, 17, 16.5, and 0 min) during the biological night. The bright broadband polychromatic light suppressed melatonin and enhanced alertness. Functional imaging revealed that a large-scale occipito-parietal attention network, including the right intraparietal sulcus, was more active in proportion to the duration of light exposures preceding the scans. Activity in the hypothalamus decreased in proportion to previous illumination. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of light on human behavior.},

How the direct impact of light on brain function varies with wavelength of light, circadian phase, and sleep homeostasis, and how this differs between individuals, is a largely unexplored area. Using functional MRI, we compared the effects of 1 minute of low-intensity blue (473 nm) and green light (527 nm) exposures on brain responses to an auditory working memory task while varying circadian phase and status of the sleep homeostat. Data were collected in 27 subjects genotyped for the PER3 VNTR (12 PER3(5/5) and 15 PER3(4/4) ) in whom it was previously shown that the brain responses to this task, when conducted in darkness, depend on circadian phase, sleep homeostasis, and genotype. In the morning after sleep, blue light, relative to green light, increased brain responses primarily in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the intraparietal sulcus, but only in PER3(4/4) individuals. By contrast, in the morning after sleep loss, blue light increased brain responses in a left thalamofrontoparietal circuit to a larger extent than green light, and only so in PER3(5/5) individuals. In the evening wake maintenance zone following a normal waking day, no differential effect of 1 minute of blue versus green light was observed in either genotype. Comparison of the current results with the findings observed in darkness indicates that light acts as an activating agent particularly under those circumstances in which and in those individuals in whom brain function is jeopardized by an adverse circadian phase and high homeostatic sleep pressure.},

These effects are mediated in part by melanopsin-expressing light-sensitive ganglion cells that, in contrast to the classical photopic system that is maximally sensitive to green light (550 nm), is very sensitive to blue light (470-480 nm). At present, there is no evidence that blue light exposure is effective in modulating nonvisual brain activity related to complex cognitive tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that, while participants perform an auditory working memory task, a short (18 min) daytime exposure to blue (470 nm) or green (550 nm) monochromatic light (3 x 10(13) photons/cm2/s) differentially modulates regional brain responses. Blue light typically enhanced brain responses or at least prevented the decline otherwise observed following green light exposure in frontal and parietal cortices implicated in working memory, and in the thalamus involved in the modulation of cognition by arousal. Our results imply that monochromatic light can affect cognitive functions almost instantaneously and suggest that these effects are mediated by a melanopsin-based photoreceptor system.},

The contribution of the melanopsin system and the brain mechanisms involved in the establishment of such responses to light remain to be established.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe exposed 15 participants to short duration (50 s) monochromatic violet (430 nm), blue (473 nm), and green (527 nm) light exposures of equal photon flux (1013ph/cm2/s) while they were performing a working memory task in fMRI. At light onset, blue light, as compared to green light, increased activity in the left hippocampus, left thalamus, and right amygdala. During the task, blue light, as compared to violet light, increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus, left thalamus and a bilateral area of the brainstem consistent with activation of the locus coeruleus.Conclusion/SignificanceThese results support a prominent contribution of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells to brain responses to light within the very first seconds of an exposure.

Here, we report that the alerting response of light as well as its effects on thermoregulation and heart rate are also wavelength dependent. Exposure to 2 h of monochromatic light at 460 nm in the late evening induced a significantly greater melatonin suppression than occurred with 550-nm monochromatic light, concomitant with a significantly greater alerting response and increased core body temperature and heart rate ( approximately 2.8 x 10(13) photons/cm(2)/sec for each light treatment). Light diminished the distal-proximal skin temperature gradient, a measure of the degree of vasoconstriction, independent of wavelength. Nonclassical ocular photoreceptors with peak sensitivity around 460 nm have been found to regulate circadian rhythm function as measured by melatonin suppression and phase shifting. Our findings-that the sensitivity of the human alerting response to light and its thermoregulatory sequelae are blue-shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system-indicate an additional role for these novel photoreceptors in modifying human alertness, thermophysiology, and heart rate.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the acute effects of ocular light exposure on alertness, performance, waking electroencephalogram (EEG), and cortisol.
DESIGN: A between-subjects design was employed to compare the effects of exposure to 460-nm or 555-nm light for 6.5 hours during the biological night.
SETTING: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.
PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy adults (8 women; mean age +/- SD = 23.3 +/- 2.4 years).
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were exposed to equal photon densities (2.8 x 10(13) photons x cm(-2) x s(-1)) of either 460-nm (n = 8) or 555-nm (n = 8) monochromatic light for 6.5 hours, 15 minutes after mydriasis.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjects underwent continuous EEG/electrooculogram recordings and completed a performance battery every 30 to 60 minutes. As compared with those exposed to 555-nm light, subjects exposed to 460-nm light had significantly lower subjective sleepiness ratings, decreased auditory reaction time, fewer attentional failures, decreased EEG power density in the delta-theta range (0.5-5.5 Hz), and increased EEG power density in the high-alpha range (9.5-10.5 Hz). Light had no direct effect on cortisol.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-wavelength sensitivity to the acute alerting effects of light indicates that the visual photopic system is not the primary photoreceptor system mediating these responses to light. The frequency-specific changes in the waking EEG indicate that short-wavelength light is a powerful agent that immediately attenuates the negative effects of both homeostatic sleep pressure and the circadian drive for sleep on alertness, performance, and the ability to sustain attention.},

A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90\% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength-enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.},

Compared to the effects of light on human circadian rhythms, little attention has been paid to its acute alerting action. Here I summarize studies from the past two decades, which have defined and quantified the dose (illuminance levels), exposure duration, timing and wavelength of light needed to evoke alerting responses in humans, as well as their temporal relationship to light-induced changes in endocrinological and electrophysiological sequelae of alertness. Furthermore, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological findings from animal studies elucidating a potential role of light in the regulation of sleep/wake states are discussed. A brief outlook of promising clinical and non-clinical applications of lights' alerting properties will be given, and its involvement in the design of more effective lighting at home and in the workplace will be considered.},

Recently, the use of methods such as fMRI to assess light effects on nonvisual brain responses has revealed how light can optimize brain function during specific cognitive tasks, especially in tasks of sustained attention. In this chapter, we address two main issues: how light impinges on cognition via consolidation of human sleep-wake cycles; and how light directly impacts on sleep and cognition, in particular in tasks of sustained attention. A thorough understanding of how light affects sleep and cognitive performance may help to improve light settings at home and at the workplace in order to improve well-being.},

  abstract = {Periodic, well timed exposure to light is important for our health and wellbeing. Light, in particular in the blue part of the spectrum, is thought to affect alertness both indirectly, by modifying circadian rhythms, and directly, giving rise to acute effects. We performed a systematic review of empirical studies on direct, acute effects of light on alertness to evaluate the reliability of these effects. In total, we identified 68 studies in which either light intensity, spectral distribution, or both were manipulated, and evaluated the effects on behavioral measures of alertness, either subjectively or measured in reaction time performance tasks. The results show that increasing the intensity of polychromatic white light has been found to increase subjective ratings of alertness in a majority of studies, though a substantial proportion of studies failed to find significant effects, possibly due to small sample sizes or high baseline light intensities. The effect of the color temperature of white light on subjective alertness is less clear. Some studies found increased alertness with higher color temperatures, but other studies reported no detrimental effects of filtering out the short wavelengths from the spectrum. Similarly, studies that used monochromatic light exposure showed no systematic pattern for the effects of blue light compared to longer wavelengths. Far fewer studies investigated the effects of light intensity or spectrum on alertness as measured with reaction time tasks and of those, very few reported significant effects. In general, the small sample sizes used in studies on acute alerting effects of light make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions and better powered studies are needed, especially studies that allow for the construction of dose-response curves.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn, remember, and respond to emotional events is a powerful survival strategy. However, dysregulated behavioral and physiological responses to these memories are maladaptive. To fully understand learned fear and the pathologies that arise during response malfunction we must reveal the environmental variables that influence learned fear responses. Light, a ubiquitous environmental feature, modulates cognition and anxiety. We hypothesized that light modulates responses to learned fear. Using tone-cued fear conditioning, we found that light enhances behavioral responses to learned fear in C57BL/6J mice. Mice in light freeze more in response to a conditioned cue than mice in darkness. The absence of significant freezing during a 2-wk habituation period and during intertrial intervals indicated that light specifically modulates freezing to the learned acoustic cue rather than the context of the experimental chamber. Repeating our assay in two photoreceptor mutant models, Pde6b(rd1/rd1) and Opn4(-/-) mice, revealed that light-dependent enhancement of conditioned fear is driven primarily by the rods and/or cones. By repeating our protocol with an altered lighting regimen, we found that lighting conditions acutely modulate responses when altered between conditioning and testing. This is manifested either as an enhancement of freezing when light is added during testing or as a depression of freezing when light is removed during testing. Acute enhancement, but not depression, requires both rod/cone- and melanopsin-dependent photoreception. Our results demonstrate a modulation by light of behavioral responses to learned fear.},

Animals that swam under BLC had a higher serum corticosterone level than those under DLC. Animals pretrained under DLC had a lower serum corticosterone level than those directly exposed to BLC. Our results also show that animals under BLC had a higher level of thigmotaxis (a behavioral anxiety measure during testing) than under DLC. Correlation analysis shows that corticosterone and thigmotaxis levels have a positive correlation with escape latency, indicating that corticosterone and thigmotaxis levels have a negative correlation with learning/memory performance.

Investigation of these dynamics can be confounded by the role of the stressor in motivating performance in a task. Positing a cohesive model of the effect of stress on learning and memory necessitates elucidating the consequences of stressful stimuli independently from task-specific functions. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effect of manipulating a task-independent stressor (elevated light level) on short-term and long-term memory in the novel object recognition paradigm. Short-term memory was elicited in both low light and high light conditions, but long-term memory specifically required high light conditions during the acquisition phase (familiarization trial) and was independent of the light level during retrieval (test trial). Additionally, long-term memory appeared to be independent of stress-mediated glucocorticoid release, as both low and high light produced similar levels of plasma corticosterone, which further did not correlate with subsequent memory performance. Finally, both short-term and long-term memory showed no savings between repeated experiments suggesting that this novel object recognition paradigm may be useful for longitudinal studies, particularly when investigating treatments to stabilize or enhance weak memories in neurodegenerative diseases or during age-related cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {The daily solar cycle allows organisms to synchronize their circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles to the correct temporal niche. Changes in day-length, shift-work, and transmeridian travel lead to mood alterations and cognitive function deficits. Sleep deprivation and circadian disruption underlie mood and cognitive disorders associated with irregular light schedules. Whether irregular light schedules directly affect mood and cognitive functions in the context of normal sleep and circadian rhythms remains unclear. Here we show, using an aberrant light cycle that neither changes the amount and architecture of sleep nor causes changes in the circadian timing system, that light directly regulates mood-related behaviours and cognitive functions in mice. Animals exposed to the aberrant light cycle maintain daily corticosterone rhythms, but the overall levels of corticosterone are increased. Despite normal circadian and sleep structures, these animals show increased depression-like behaviours and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and learning. Administration of the antidepressant drugs fluoxetine or desipramine restores learning in mice exposed to the aberrant light cycle, suggesting that the mood deficit precedes the learning impairments. To determine the retinal circuits underlying this impairment of mood and learning, we examined the behavioural consequences of this light cycle in animals that lack intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. In these animals, the aberrant light cycle does not impair mood and learning, despite the presence of the conventional retinal ganglion cells and the ability of these animals to detect light for image formation. These findings demonstrate the ability of light to influence cognitive and mood functions directly through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.},

Much research has focused on the effects of light on circadian rhythms and subsequent interaction with alertness and depression. The recent discovery of a third photoreceptor, melanopsin, expressed in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, allows major improvement of our understanding of how photic information is processed. Light affects behavior in two ways, either indirectly through the circadian timing system, or directly through mechanisms that are independent of the circadian system. These latter effects have barely been studied in regard to mood, but recent investigations on the direct effects of light on sleep and alertness suggest additional pathways through which light could influence mood. Based on our recent findings, we suggest that light, via melanopsin, may exert its antidepressant effect through a modulation of the homeostatic process of sleep. Further research is needed to understand how these mechanisms interplay and how they contribute to the photic regulation of mood. Such research could improve therapeutic management of affective disorders and influence the management of societal lighting conditions.},

  abstract = {Background
Increasing evidence demonstrates that motor-skill memories improve across a night of sleep, and that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep commonly plays a role in orchestrating these consolidation enhancements. Here we show the benefit of a daytime nap on motor memory consolidation and its relationship not simply with global sleep-stage measures, but unique characteristics of sleep spindles at regionally specific locations; mapping to the corresponding memory representation.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Two groups of subjects trained on a motor-skill task using their left hand – a paradigm known to result in overnight plastic changes in the contralateral, right motor cortex. Both groups trained in the morning and were tested 8 hr later, with one group obtaining a 60–90 minute intervening midday nap, while the other group remained awake. At testing, subjects that did not nap showed no significant performance improvement, yet those that did nap expressed a highly significant consolidation enhancement. Within the nap group, the amount of offline improvement showed a significant correlation with the global measure of stage-2 NREM sleep. However, topographical sleep spindle analysis revealed more precise correlations. Specifically, when spindle activity at the central electrode of the non-learning hemisphere (left) was subtracted from that in the learning hemisphere (right), representing the homeostatic difference following learning, strong positive relationships with offline memory improvement emerged–correlations that were not evident for either hemisphere alone.

Conclusions/Significance
These results demonstrate that motor memories are dynamically facilitated across daytime naps, enhancements that are uniquely associated with electrophysiological events expressed at local, anatomically discrete locations of the brain.},

Current research suggests dynamic differences in the way the central nervous system responds to acute versus chronic sleep restriction, which is reflected in new models of sleep-wake regulation. Chronic sleep restriction likely induces long-term neuromodulatory changes in brain physiology that could explain why recovery from it may require more time than from acute sleep loss. High intraclass correlations in neurobehavioral responses to sleep loss suggest that these trait-like differences are phenotypic and may include genetic components.

  abstract = {Many behavioral and electrophysiological studies in animals and humans have suggested that sleep and circadian rhythms influence memory consolidation. In rodents, hippocampus-dependent memory may be particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation after training, as spatial memory in the Morris water maze is impaired by rapid eye movement sleep deprivation following training. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze, however, requires multiple training trials and performance, as measured by time to reach the hidden platform is influenced by not only spatial learning but also procedural learning. To determine if sleep is important for the consolidation of a single-trial, hippocampus-dependent task, we sleep deprived animals for 0-5 and 5-10 h after training for contextual and cued fear conditioning. We found that sleep deprivation from 0-5 h after training for this task impaired memory consolidation for contextual fear conditioning whereas sleep deprivation from 5-10 h after training had no effect. Sleep deprivation at either time point had no effect on cued fear conditioning, a hippocampus-independent task. Previous studies have determined that memory consolidation for fear conditioning is impaired when protein kinase A and protein synthesis inhibitors are administered at the same time as when sleep deprivation is effective, suggesting that sleep deprivation may act by modifying these molecular mechanisms of memory storage.},

Several studies in rodents have shown that brief SD immediately following a mild foot shock impairs consolidation of contextual fear memory as reflected in a reduced behavioural freezing response during re-exposure to the shock context later. In the first part of this study, we examined whether this reduced freezing response is accompanied by an attenuated fear-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Results show that 6h of SD immediately following the initial shock results in a diminished adrenal corticosterone (CORT) response upon re-exposure to the shock context the next day. In the second part, we established whether the attenuated freezing response in SD animals is associated with reduced activation of relevant brain areas known to be involved in the retrieval and expression of fear memory. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain slices showed that the normal increase in phosphorylation of the transcription factor 3',5'-cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB) upon re-exposure to the shock context was reduced in SD animals in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the amygdala. In conclusion, brief SD impairs the consolidation of contextual fear memory. Upon re-exposure to the context, this is reflected in a diminished behavioural freezing response, an attenuated HPA axis response and a reduction of the normal increase of phosphorylated CREB expression in the hippocampus and amygdala.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep deprivation negatively affects memory consolidation, especially in the case of hippocampus-dependent memories. Studies in rodents have shown that 5 hours of sleep deprivation immediately following footshock exposure selectively impairs the formation of a contextual fear memory. In these studies, both acquisition and subsequent sleep deprivation were performed in the animals' main resting phase. However, in everyday life, subjects most often learn during their active phase.
DESIGN: Here we examined the effects of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation for contextual fear in rats when the task was performed at different times of the day, particularly, at the beginning of the resting phase or right before the onset of the active phase.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Results show that sleep deprivation immediately following training affects consolidation of contextual fear, independent of time of training. However, in the resting phase memory consolidation was impaired by 6 hours of posttraining sleep deprivation, whereas, in the active phase, the impairment was only seen after 12 hours of sleep deprivation. Since rats sleep at least twice as much during the resting phase compared with the active phase, these data suggest that the effect of sleep deprivation depends on the amount of sleep that was lost. Also, control experiments show that effects of sleep deprivation were not related to the amount of stimulation the animals received and were therefore not likely an indirect effect of the sleep-deprivation method.
CONCLUSION: These results support the notion that sleep immediately following acquisition, independent of time of day, promotes memory consolidation and that sleep deprivation may disrupt this process depending on the amount of sleep that is lost.},

  abstract = {Millions of people regularly obtain insufficient sleep. Given the effect of sleep deprivation on our lives, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways affected by sleep deprivation is clearly of social and clinical importance. One of the major effects of sleep deprivation on the brain is to produce memory deficits in learning models that are dependent on the hippocampus. Here we have identified a molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation alters hippocampal function. Sleep deprivation selectively impaired 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, reduced cAMP signalling, and increased activity and protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep-deprivation-induced deficits in cAMP signalling, synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings demonstrate that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal function by interfering with cAMP signalling through increased PDE4 activity. Thus, drugs that enhance cAMP signalling may provide a new therapeutic approach to counteract the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation.},

However, the mechanisms by which SD impairs long-term synaptic plasticity and cognitive function are not clear. Here, we report that 24-h SD in mice results in impaired hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and LTP and, unexpectedly, in reductions of the surface expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR1 and NMDAR-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents at hippocampal perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses. The results suggest that the reduction of functional NMDAR in hippocampal neurons may underlie the SD-induced deficits in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and long-term synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Prolonged sleep deprivation results in cognitive deficits. In rats, for example, sleep deprivation impairs spatial learning and hippocampal long-term potentiation. We tested the effects of sleep deprivation on learning in a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, choosing a sleep deprivation paradigm in which REM sleep was completely prevented and non-REM sleep was strongly decreased. During conditioning, rats were given footshocks, either alone or paired with a tone, and tested 24 h later for freezing responses to the conditioning context, and to the tone in a novel environment. Whereas control animals had robust contextual learning in both background and foreground contextual conditioning paradigms, 72 h of sleep deprivation before conditioning dramatically impaired both types of contextual learning (by more than 50\%) without affecting cued learning. Increasing the number of footshocks did not overcome the sleep deprivation-induced deficit. The results provide behavioural evidence that REM/non-REM sleep deprivation has neuroanatomically selective actions, differentially interfering with the neural systems underlying contextual learning (i.e. the hippocampus) and cued learning (i.e. the amygdala), and support the involvement of the hippocampus in both foreground and background contextual conditioning.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether paradoxical sleep deprivation-induced memory impairments are due to release of glucocorticoids, by means of corticosterone inhibition with metyrapone.
DESIGN: The design was a 2 (Groups [control, paradoxical sleep-deprived]) x 2 (Treatments [vehicle, metyrapone]) study, performed in 2 experiments: Acute treatment (single injection given immediately after 96 hours of sleep deprivation) and chronic treatment (8 injections, twice per day, throughout the sleep-deprivation period). Animals were either paradoxical sleep-deprived or remained in their home cages for 96 hours before training in contextual fear conditioning and received intraperitoneal injections of a corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone. Memory performance was tested 24 hours after training.
SUBJECTS: Three-month old Wistar male rats.
MEASUREMENTS: Freezing behavior was considered as the conditioning index, and adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone plasma levels were determined from trunk blood of animals sacrificed in different time points. Animals were weighed before and after the paradoxical sleep-deprivation period.
RESULTS: Acute metyrapone treatment impaired memory in control animals and did not prevent paradoxical sleep deprivation-induced memory impairment. Likewise, in the chronic treatment, paradoxical sleep-deprived animals did not differ from control rats in their corticosterone or adrenocorticotropic hormone response to training, but still did not learn as well, and did not show any stress responses to the testing. Chronic metyrapone was, however, effective in preventing the weight loss typically observed in paradoxical sleep-deprived animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that glucocorticoids do not mediate memory impairments but might be responsible for the weight loss induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation.},

In particular, the proposal is reviewed in relation to recent animal work with rats and results from human clinical studies. Notably, progress has been made in determining potential neural memory substrate mechanisms within the perirhinal cortex in rats. Recent findings have emphasized the importance of specifying the type of material, the type of test, and the strategy used by subjects to solve recognition memory tests if substrates are to be accurately inferred. It is to be expected that the default condition is that both the hippocampal and perirhinal systems will contribute to recognition memory performance. Indeed, rat lesion experiments provide examples of where cooperation between both systems is essential. Nevertheless, there remain examples of the independent operation of the hippocampal and perirhinal systems. Overall, it is concluded that most, though not all, of the recent findings are in support of the proposal. However, there is also evidence that the systems involved in recognition memory need to include structures outside the medial temporal lobe: there are significant but as yet only partially defined roles for the prefrontal cortex and sensory association cortices in recognition memory processes.},

Although well established in humans, the role of the rodent hippocampus in object memory remains highly debated due to conflicting findings across temporary and permanent hippocampal lesion studies and evidence that the perirhinal cortex may support object memory. In the current studies, we used intrahippocampal muscimol microinfusions to transiently inactivate the male C57BL/6J mouse hippocampus at distinct stages during the novel object recognition (NOR) task: during object memory encoding and consolidation, just consolidation, and/or retrieval. We also assessed the effect of temporary hippocampal inactivation when objects were presented in different contexts, thus eliminating the spatial or contextual components of the task. Lastly, we assessed extracellular dorsal hippocampal glutamate efflux and firing properties of hippocampal neurons while mice performed the NOR task. Our results reveal a clear and compelling role of the rodent hippocampus in nonspatial object memory.},

We have previously shown that astrocyte-derived adenosine is a candidate molecule involved in the cognitive deficits following a brief period of SD (). In this study, we examined whether genetic disruption of SNARE-dependent exocytosis in astrocytes (dnSNARE mice) or pharmacological blockade of A1 receptor signaling using an adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT) could prevent the negative effects of 6 hours of SD on hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and hippocampus-dependent spatial object recognition memory. We found that SD impaired L-LTP in wild-type mice but not in dnSNARE mice. Similarly, this deficit in L-LTP resulting from SD was prevented by a chronic infusion of CPT. Consistent with these results, we found that hippocampus-dependent memory deficits produced by SD were rescued in dnSNARE mice and CPT-treated mice. These data provide the first evidence that astrocytic ATP and adenosine A1R activity contribute to the effects of SD on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory, and suggest a new therapeutic target to reverse the hippocampus-related cognitive deficits induced by sleep loss.},

Inhibiting gliotransmission attenuated the accumulation of sleep pressure, assessed by measuring the slow wave activity of the EEG during NREM sleep, and prevented cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. Since the sleep-suppressing effects of the A1 receptor antagonist CPT were prevented following inhibition of gliotransmission and because intracerebroventricular delivery of CPT to wild-type mice mimicked the transgenic phenotype, we conclude that astrocytes modulate the accumulation of sleep pressure and its cognitive consequences through a pathway involving A1 receptors.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is particularly sensitive to sleep loss. Although previous work has indicated that sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal cAMP signaling, it remains to be determined whether the cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation are caused by attenuated cAMP signaling in the hippocampus. Further, it is unclear which cell types are responsible for the memory impairments associated with sleep deprivation. Transgenic approaches lack the spatial resolution to manipulate specific signaling pathways selectively in the hippocampus, while pharmacological strategies are limited in terms of cell-type specificity. Therefore, we used a pharmacogenetic approach based on a virus-mediated expression of a Gαs-coupled Drosophila octopamine receptor selectively in mouse hippocampal excitatory neurons in vivo. With this approach, a systemic injection with the receptor ligand octopamine leads to increased cAMP levels in this specific set of hippocampal neurons. We assessed whether transiently increasing cAMP levels during sleep deprivation prevents memory consolidation deficits associated with sleep loss in an object–location task. Five hours of total sleep deprivation directly following training impaired the formation of object–location memories. Transiently increasing cAMP levels in hippocampal neurons during the course of sleep deprivation prevented these memory consolidation deficits. These findings demonstrate that attenuated cAMP signaling in hippocampal excitatory neurons is a critical component underlying the memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks associated with sleep deprivation.},

  abstract = {Many studies in animals and humans suggest that sleep facilitates learning, memory consolidation, and retrieval. Moreover, sleep deprivation (SD) incurred after learning, impaired memory in humans, mice, rats, and hamsters. We investigated the importance of sleep and its timing in an object recognition task in OF1 mice subjected to 6h SD either immediately after the acquisition phase (0-6 SD) or 6h later (7-12 SD), and in corresponding undisturbed controls. Motor activity was continuously recorded with infrared sensors. All groups explored two familiar, previously encountered objects to a similar extent, both at the end of the acquisition phase and 24h later during the test phase, indicating intact familiarity detection. During the test phase 0-6 SD mice failed to discriminate between the single novel and the two familiar objects. In contrast, the 7-12 SD group and the two control groups explored the novel object significantly longer than the two familiar objects. Plasma corticosterone levels determined after SD did not differ from time-matched undisturbed controls, but were significantly below the level measured after learning alone. ACTH did not differ between the groups. Therefore, it is unlikely that stress contributed to the memory impairment. We conclude that the loss of sleep and the activities the mice engaged in during the SD, impaired recognition memory retrieval, when they occurred immediately after acquisition. The delayed SD enabled memory consolidation during the 6h when the mice were allowed to sleep, and had no detrimental effect on memory. Neither SD schedule impaired object familiarity processing, suggesting that only specific cognitive abilities were sensitive to the intervention. Sleep may either actively promote memory formation, or alternatively, sleep may provide optimal conditions of non-interference for consolidation.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze represents the de-facto standard for testing hippocampal function in laboratory rodents. In the field of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, however, using this paradigm to assess the functional relevance of the new neurons yielded surprisingly inconsistent results. While some authors found aspects of water maze performance to be linked to adult neurogenesis, others obtained different results or could not demonstrate any effect of manipulating adult neurogenesis. In this review we discuss evidence that the large diversity of protocols and setups used is an important aspect in interpreting the differences in the results that have been obtained. Even simple parameters such as pool size, number, and configuration of visual landmarks, or number of trials can become highly relevant for getting the new neurons involved at all. Sets of parameters are often chosen with implicit or explicit concepts in mind and these might lead to different views on the function of adult-generated neurons. We propose that the classical parameters usually used to measure spatial learning performance in the water maze might not be particularly well-suited to sensitively and specifically detect the supposedly highly specific functional changes elicited by the experimental modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As adult neurogenesis is supposed to affect specific aspects of information processing only in the hippocampus, any claim for a functional relevance of the new neurons has to be based on hippocampus-specific parameters. We also placed a special emphasis on the fact that the dentate gyrus (DG) facilitates the differentiation between contexts as opposed to just differentiating places. In conclusion, while the Morris water maze has proven to be one of the most effective testing paradigms to assess hippocampus-dependent spatial learning, new and more specific questions ask for new parameters. Therefore, the full potential of the water maze task remains to be tapped.},

  abstract = {It is known that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Previous studies have demonstrated that postlearning REM sleep deprivation (RSD) impairs memory consolidation. Most of these studies observed only the effects of RSD on learning and memory. In the present study, we not only investigated the impacts of 48-h RSD on the spatial reference memory of young rats in a Morris water maze, but also specifically examined whether an REM rebound for 24-48 h after 48-h RSD affected the maintenance of spatial reference memory. RSD was induced by the modified multiple platform method, and spatial reference memory was tested in a Morris water maze. The results demonstrated that, compared with the control groups, posttraining RSD for 48 h produced a significant impairment in the retention of acquired spatial reference memory, and the impairment continuously existed after 24 and 48 h of release from sleep deprivation, which indicates that REM sleep plays a critical role in reference memory maintenance and consolidation. Moreover, postlearning RSD may lead to a long-term impairment in the consolidation of newly acquired memories.},

However, the mechanism of memory impairment induced by sleep deprivation is poorly understood. The present study investigated the effect of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on spatial learning and memory using the Morris Water Maze. Effects of PSD on CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus were also examined. PSD impaired spatial learning of rats. PSD induced translocation of Bax to mitochondria and cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, and decreased the membrane excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, effects which may contribute to the deficits in learning behavior. These results may partially explain the mechanism of the effect of PSD on learning. Modulating the excitability of hippocampal neurons and protecting mitochondrial function are possible targets for preventing the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation.},

SD was induced in male Wistar rats by housing them on small platforms over water. They fell into the water if they lost muscle tone. Controls were either housed in tanks with large platforms (TC) or in normal cages (CC). All rats had free access to food and water. Each day they were tested in a place-learning set task using a Morris water maze. The rats were released from 6 different starting points (sets) and allowed 2 min to find a submerged platform. Two trials were conducted from each starting point. SD caused a significant decrement in performance in Trial 1 from Day 2. By Day 4, when distance swum to find the platform was plotted against set, area under the curve was doubled in SD compared to that in TC and CC rats, indicating a significant impairment in reference spatial memory. There was no consistent effect on working memory, indicated by Trial 2. SD caused weight loss and increased serum corticosterone compared to that in CC rats. There were no differences in concentrations of hypothalamic, hippocampal, or cortical catecholamines or their metabolites. Serotonin metabolism was elevated in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in SD rats. These results indicate that SD induced in rats housed on small platforms causes a substantial impairment of reference memory. The memory deficit may not be specific to SD because the rats are physically stressed and lose some nonREM sleep when housed in these conditions.},

  abstract = {This first test of the role of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep in reversal spatial learning is also the first attempt to replicate a much cited pair of papers reporting that REM sleep deprivation impairs the consolidation of initial spatial learning in the Morris water maze. We hypothesized that REM sleep deprivation following training would impair both hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and learning a new target location within a familiar environment: reversal learning. A 6-d protocol was divided into the initial spatial learning phase (3.5 d) immediately followed by the reversal phase (2.5 d). During the 6 h following four or 12 training trials/day of initial or reversal learning phases, REM sleep was eliminated and non-REM sleep left intact using the multiple inverted flowerpot method. Contrary to our hypotheses, REM sleep deprivation during four or 12 trials/day of initial spatial or reversal learning did not affect training performance. However, some probe trial measures indicated REM sleep-deprivation-associated impairment in initial spatial learning with four trials/day and enhancement of subsequent reversal learning. In naive animals, REM sleep deprivation during normal initial spatial learning was followed by a lack of preference for the subsequent reversal platform location during the probe. Our findings contradict reports that REM sleep is essential for spatial learning in the Morris water maze and newly reveal that short periods of REM sleep deprivation do not impair concurrent reversal learning. Effects on subsequent reversal learning are consistent with the idea that REM sleep serves the consolidation of incompletely learned items.},

Sleep deprivation (SD) may affect subsequent learning capacity and ability to form new memories, particularly in the case of hippocampus-dependent tasks. In the present study we examined whether SD for 6 or 12 h during the normal resting phase prior to learning affects hippocampus-dependent working memory in mice. In addition, we determined effects of SD on hippocampal glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and their regulatory pathways, which are crucially involved in working memory. After 12 h SD, but not yet after 6 h, spatial working memory in a novel arm recognition task was significantly impaired. This deficit was not likely due to stress as corticosterone levels after SD were not significantly different between groups. In parallel with the change in cognitive function, we found that 12 h SD significantly reduced hippocampal AMPA receptor phosphorylation at the GluR1-S845 site, which is important for incorporation of the receptors into the membrane. SD did not affect protein levels of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) or phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which regulate GluR1 phosphorylation. However, SD did reduce the expression of the scaffolding molecule A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150), which binds and partly controls the actions of PKA and CaN. In conclusion, a relatively short SD during the normal resting phase may affect spatial working memory in mice by reducing hippocampal AMPA receptor function through a change in AKAP150 levels. Together, these findings provide further insight into the possible mechanism of SD-induced hippocampal dysfunction and memory impairment.},

  abstract = {It is clear from this literature that fragmented sleep is less restorative than consolidated sleep, and leads to sleepiness-related daytime impairment. The optimal approach to the quantification of sleep fragmentation continues to be debated. Modest and erratic correlations between measures of sleepiness and traditional measures of EEG arousals have pushed investigators to try and find more sensitive measures of sleep fragmentation. Simply correlating various measures of sleep fragmentation with a measure of sleepiness has significant limitations. Since sleep fragmentation is not the only factor affecting daytime sleepiness, these correlations can be misleading. For example, a subject with severely fragmented sleep will show elevated sleepiness during the day. However, the overall correlation may be reduced because lack of fragmented sleep does not guarantee that the level of sleepiness will be low. Multivariate statistical modeling is needed to account for sources of variance simultaneously in the prediction of daytime sleepiness. In this way it may be possible to identify the optimal definition of sleep fragmentation. More studies are needed that evaluate "sub-cortical" arousals, EEG arousals, and daytime function simultaneously. Ideally, clarification of these measurement issues will lead to an improved understanding of sleep structure and the mechanism through which sleep fragmentation impacts daytime function.},

However, during the active phase of the circadian wheel running cycle some NREM and REM sleep did occur; conversely, during its rest phase, wakefulness was often present.

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep fragmentation (SF) is an integral feature of sleep apnea and other prevalent sleep disorders. Although the effect of repetitive arousals on cognitive performance is well documented, the effects of long-term SF on electroencephalography (EEG) and molecular markers of sleep homeostasis remain poorly investigated. To address this question, we developed a mouse model of chronic SF and characterized its effect on EEG spectral frequencies and the expression of genes previously linked to sleep homeostasis including clock genes, heat shock proteins, and plasticity-related genes.
DESIGN: N/A.
SETTING: Animal sleep research laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six C57BL6/J adult mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Instrumental sleep disruption at a rate of 60/h during 14 days.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Locomotor activity and EEG were recorded during 14 days of SF followed by recovery for 2 days. Despite a dramatic number of arousals and decreased sleep bout duration, SF minimally reduced total quantity of sleep and did not significantly alter its circadian distribution. Spectral analysis during SF revealed a homeostatic drive for slow wave activity (SWA; 1-4 Hz) and other frequencies as well (4-40 Hz). Recordings during recovery revealed slow wave sleep consolidation and a transient rebound in SWA, and paradoxical sleep duration. The expression of selected genes was not induced following chronic SF.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic SF increased sleep pressure confirming that altered quality with preserved quantity triggers core sleep homeostasis mechanisms. However, it did not induce the expression of genes induced by sleep loss, suggesting that these molecular pathways are not sustainably activated in chronic diseases involving SF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction are recognized as prominent consequences of sleep deprivation. Experimentally induced short-term sleep fragmentation, even in the absence of any reductions in total sleep duration, will lead to the emergence of excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairments in humans. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has important regulatory effects on sleep, and seems to play a role in the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness in children who have disrupted sleep as a result of obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with prominent sleep fragmentation. The aim of this study was to examine role of the TNF-α pathway after long-term sleep fragmentation in mice.
METHODS: The effect of chronic sleep fragmentation during the sleep-predominant period on sleep architecture, sleep latency, cognitive function, behavior, and inflammatory markers was assessed in C57BL/6 J and in mice lacking the TNF-α receptor (double knockout mice). In addition, we also assessed the above parameters in C57BL/6 J mice after injection of a TNF-α neutralizing antibody.
RESULTS: Mice subjected to chronic sleep fragmentation had preserved sleep duration, sleep state distribution, and cumulative delta frequency power, but also exhibited excessive sleepiness, altered cognitive abilities and mood correlates, reduced cyclic AMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, and increased phosphodiesterase-4 expression, in the absence of AMP kinase-α phosphorylation and ATP changes. Selective increases in cortical expression of TNF-α primarily circumscribed to neurons emerged. Consequently, sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction were absent in TNF-α double receptor knockout mice subjected to sleep fragmentation, and similarly, treatment with a TNF-α neutralizing antibody abrogated sleep fragmentation-induced learning deficits and increases in sleep propensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings show that recurrent arousals during sleep, as happens during sleep apnea, induce excessive sleepiness via activation of inflammatory mechanisms, and more specifically TNF-α-dependent pathways, despite preserved sleep duration.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73\% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.},

Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {Sleep is universal, tightly regulated, and its loss impairs cognition. But why does the brain need to disconnect from the environment for hours every day? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout the brain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity.},

  abstract = {Exposure to a spatial location leads to habituation of exploration such that, in a novelty preference test, rodents subsequently prefer exploring a novel location to the familiar location. According to Wagner's (1981) theory of memory, short-term and long-term habituation are caused by separate and sometimes opponent processes. In the present study, this dual-process account of memory was tested. Mice received a series of exposure training trials to a location before receiving a novelty preference test. The novelty preference was greater when tested after a short, rather than a long, interval. In contrast, the novelty preference was weaker when exposure training trials were separated by a short, rather than a long interval. Furthermore, it was found that long-term habituation was determined by the independent effects of the amount of exposure training and the number of exposure training trials when factors such as the intertrial interval and the cumulative intertrial interval were controlled. A final experiment demonstrated that a long-term reduction of exploration could be caused by a negative priming effect due to associations formed during exploration. These results provide evidence against a single-process account of habituation and suggest that spatial habituation is determined by both short-term, recency-based memory and long-term, incrementally strengthened memory.},

  abstract = {The GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit is a key mediator of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and is especially important for a rapidly-induced, short-lasting form of potentiation. GluA1 gene deletion impairs hippocampus-dependent, spatial working memory, but spares hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory. These findings may reflect the necessity of GluA1-dependent synaptic plasticity for short-term memory of recently visited places, but not for the ability to form long-term associations between a particular spatial location and an outcome. This hypothesis is in concordance with the theory that short-term and long-term memory depend on dissociable psychological processes. In this study we tested GluA1-/- mice on both short-term and long-term spatial memory using a simple novelty preference task. Mice were given a series of repeated exposures to a particular spatial location (the arm of a Y-maze) before their preference for a novel spatial location (the unvisited arm of the maze) over the familiar spatial location was assessed. GluA1-/- mice were impaired if the interval between the trials was short (1 min), but showed enhanced spatial memory if the interval between the trials was long (24 h). This enhancement was caused by the interval between the exposure trials rather than the interval prior to the test, thus demonstrating enhanced learning and not simply enhanced performance or expression of memory. This seemingly paradoxical enhancement of hippocampus-dependent spatial learning may be caused by GluA1 gene deletion reducing the detrimental effects of short-term memory on subsequent long-term learning. Thus, these results support a dual-process model of memory in which short-term and long-term memory are separate and sometimes competitive processes.},

Waking and sleep are associated with changes in the levels of GluA1 AMPAR subunit in synaptic membranes, while studies using genetically-modified mice have identified an important role for GluA1-dependent synaptic plasticity in a non-associative form of memory that underlies short-term habituation to recently experienced stimuli. Here we posit that sleep may play a role in dishabituation, which restores attentional capacity and maximises the readiness of the animal for learning and goal-directed behaviour during subsequent wakefulness. Furthermore we suggest that sleep disturbance may fundamentally change the nature of behaviour, making it more model-free and habitual as a result of reduced attentional capacity.},

  abstract = {Restraint represents psychological and physical stress. Methods used to model restraint stress in mice vary in duration, time of day during which restraint is applied, and the strain of mouse tested. The goals of this study were: (1) to identify the optimal daily time periods during which the stress response is maximized, and (2) to describe mouse strain differences, if any, in response to restraint. Groups of outbred CD-1 and inbred C57BL/6 mice were restrained for 3 h during three time points of the daily light-dark cycle: (1) the late light phase, (2) the transition between the light phase and the dark phase, and (3) the mid-dark phase. Additional mice served as control groups for food deprivation or were unhandled except for blood sampling. Mice of both strains lost significant body mass after 3 days of restraint. Unrestrained food-deprived mice lost body mass, particularly if food-deprived during transition periods. Corticosterone was elevated in restrained mice compared with control mice. Neither basal nor postrestraint corticosterone differed between strains. Corticosterone was elevated by food deprivation during transitional periods in CD-1 mice and during both transition and dark phases in C57 mice. Corticosterone response in restrained CD-1 mice was increased during the dark phase. These results suggest that the physiological response to restraint is similar in both strains. However, corticosterone responses to both restraint and food deprivation were highest during the transitional and dark phases.},

  abstract = {Adrenal glucocorticoids are major modulators of multiple functions, including energy metabolism, stress responses, immunity, and cognition. The endogenous secretion of glucocorticoids is normally characterized by a prominent and robust circadian (around 24 hours) oscillation, with a daily peak around the time of the habitual sleep-wake transition and minimal levels in the evening and early part of the night. It has long been recognized that this 24-hour rhythm partly reflects the activity of a master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the past decade, secondary circadian clocks based on the same molecular machinery as the central master pacemaker were found in other brain areas as well as in most peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that misalignment between central and peripheral clocks has a host of adverse effects. The robust rhythm in circulating glucocorticoid levels has been recognized as a major internal synchronizer of the circadian system. The present review examines the scientific foundation of these novel advances and their implications for health and disease prevention and treatment.},

In the context of allostasis, resilience denotes the ability of an organism to respond to stressors in the environment by means of the appropriate engagement and efficient termination of allostatic responses. In this review, we discuss the neurobiological and organismal factors that modulate resilience, such as growth factors, chaperone molecules and circadian rhythms, and highlight its consequences for cognition and behavior.},

Male OTKO and control wild-type mice with carotid arterial catheters were exposed to intermittent shaker stress for 7 days (2 min stressors, 45 times per day). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded continuously (24 h) before stress (basal), on stress days 1, 3 and 7 (S1, S3 and S7) and 1 day poststress (recovery). Plasma corticosterone (Cort) was measured before stress and 30 min after the last stress on day 7. Twenty-four hour averages of MAP and HR were lower in OTKO mice than in controls (P {$<$} 0.0001 and P {$<$} 0.005, respectively) with a significant diurnal rhythm. Chronic stress (S1 and S3) produced an increase in 24 h average MAP in OTKO mice, but not in controls. There were no stress-related changes in 24 h average HR values between control and OTKO mice. The immediate pressor responses were analysed during the dark and light periods (19.00 and 08.00 h). During the dark period, stress-induced pressor responses were observed only in OTKO mice (S1 and S3). In the light period, stress-induced MAP increases were seen on all days in OTKO mice and on days S1 and S3 in controls. There were no differences in baseline Cort between the groups; however, OTKO mice showed a reduced response to chronic stress (+298 versus+411\%, OTKO mice versus controls, P {$<$} 0.005). In conclusion, oxytocin deficiency alters the endocrine and pressor responses to chronic stress, suggesting that the endogenous oxytocin system is important in regulating the stress-induced pressor response.},

We investigated this issue in male Sprague-Dawley rats by examining the effects of immediate posttraining systemic injections of the glucocorticoid corticosterone on object recognition memory under two conditions that differed in their training-associated emotional arousal. In rats that were not previously habituated to the experimental context, corticosterone (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) administered immediately after a 3-min training trial enhanced 24-hr retention performance in an inverted-U shaped dose-response relationship. In contrast, corticosterone did not affect 24-hr retention of rats that received extensive prior habituation to the experimental context and, thus, had decreased novelty-induced emotional arousal during training. Additionally, immediate posttraining administration of corticosterone to nonhabituated rats, in doses that enhanced 24-hr retention, impaired object recognition performance at a 1-hr retention interval whereas corticosterone administered after training to well-habituated rats did not impair 1-hr retention. Thus, the present findings suggest that training-induced emotional arousal may be essential for glucocorticoid effects on object recognition memory.},

Following decades of psychological, neurophysiological and molecular investigations, generalized CNS arousal can now be analyzed using approaches usually applied to physical systems. The concept of "criticality" is a state that illustrates an advantage for arousal systems poised near a phase transition. This property provides speed and sensitivity and facilitates the transition of the system into different brain states, especially as the brain crosses a phase transition from less aroused to more aroused states. In summary, concepts derived from applied mathematics of physical systems will now find their application in this area of neuroscience, the neurobiology of CNS arousal.},

DBS is currently being used in the treatment of a broad range of diseases, but its underlying principles are still unclear. Because mouse movement involves rapidly repeated starting and stopping, one must statistically verify that the movement at a given stimulation time was not just coincidental, endogenously-driven movement. Moreover, the amount of activity changes significantly over the circadian rhythm, and hence the means, variances and autocorrelations are all time varying. A new methodology is presented. For example, to discern what is and what is not impacted by stimulation, velocity is classified (in a time-evolving manner) as being zero-, one- and two-dimensional movement. The most important conclusions of the paper are: (1) (DBS) stimulation is proven to be truly effective; (2) it is two-dimensional (2-D) movement that strongly differs between light and dark and responds to stimulation; and, (3) stimulation in the light initiates a manner of movement, 2-D movement, that is more commonly seen in the (non-stimulated) dark. Based upon these conclusions, it is conjectured that the above patterns of 2-D movement could be a straightforward, easy to calculate correlate of arousal. The above conclusions will aid in the systematic evaluation and understanding of how DBS in CNS arousal pathways leads to the activation of behavior.},

The abnormal sleep that is experienced by these patients is largely assumed to be the product of medication or some other influence that is not well defined. However, normal brain function and the generation of sleep are linked by common neurotransmitter systems and regulatory pathways. Disruption of sleep alters sleep-wake timing, destabilizes physiology and promotes a range of pathologies (from cognitive to metabolic defects) that are rarely considered to be associated with abnormal sleep. We propose that brain disorders and abnormal sleep have a common mechanistic origin and that many co-morbid pathologies that are found in brain disease arise from a destabilization of sleep mechanisms. The stabilization of sleep may be a means by which to reduce the symptoms of--and permit early intervention of--psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {Chronic circadian disturbance, a condition of desynchronization between endogenous clock and environmental light-dark (LD) cycle, is known to cause adverse physiological changes including mortality. However, it is yet unclear whether these consequences result from disturbance of endogenous clock or condition of the LD cycle per se. To address this issue, we imposed 3 different periods of LD cycle (T) on wild type and functional clock-defective (Per1(-/-)Per2(-/-)) mice. We found that the disturbed rhythms of locomotor activity and body temperature resulted from interaction of endogenous clock and T cycle and the chronic state of the disturbance suppressed the endogenous circadian rhythm. Interestingly, the endogenous clock and the T cycles affected body weight and food intake independently, while their interaction affected the life span resulting increased mortality of wild type mice in a shortened T cycle. These results strongly indicate the presence of both separate and combined effects of the endogenous clock and T cycle on different physiological variables implying that shift work scheduling can be an important influence on health parameters.},

However, the consequences of circadian dysfunction that might demonstrate a primary adaptive advantage and explain the natural origins and apparent ubiquity of circadian systems have not been documented. The authors report that longevity in hamsters is decreased with a noninvasive disruption of rhythmicity and is increased in older animals given suprachiasmatic implants that restore higher amplitude rhythms.

The point mutation in the circadian regulatory gene, casein kinase-1epsilon, produces early onset circadian entrainment with fragmented patterns of behavior in +/tau heterozygotes. Animals die at a younger age with cardiomyopathy, extensive fibrosis, and severely impaired contractility; they also have severe renal disease with proteinuria, tubular dilation, and cellular apoptosis. On light cycles appropriate for their genotype (22 h), cyclic behavioral patterns are normalized, cardiorenal phenotype is reversed, and hearts and kidneys show normal structure and function. Moreover, hypertrophy does not develop in animals whose suprachiasmatic nucleus was ablated as young adults. Circadian organization therefore is critical for normal health and longevity, whereas chronic global asynchrony is implicated in the etiology of cardiac and renal disease.},

Unfortunately, many people are living in an environment where their circadian system is challenged by inappropriate meal- or work-times. Here we scheduled food access to the sleep time and examined the impact on learning and memory in mice. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that the molecular clock in the master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is unaltered while the molecular clock in the hippocampus is synchronized by the timing of food availability. This chronic circadian misalignment causes reduced hippocampal long term potentiation and total CREB expression. Importantly this mis-timed feeding resulted in dramatic deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest that the timing of meals have far-reaching effects on hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour.},

  abstract = {, In mammals, a master circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus maintains the phase coherence among a wide array of behavioral and physiological circadian rhythms. Affective disorders are typically associated with disruption of this fine-tuned “internal synchronization,” but whether this internal misalignment is part of the physiopathology of mood disorders is not clear. To date, depressive-like behavior in animal models has been induced by methods that fail to specifically target the SCN regulation of internal synchronization as the mode to generate depression. In the rat, exposure to a 22-h light-dark cycle (LD22) leads to the uncoupling of two distinct populations of neuronal oscillators within the SCN. This genetically, neurally, and pharmacologically intact animal model represents a unique opportunity to assess the effect of a systematic challenge to the central circadian pacemaker on phenotypic manifestations of mood disorders. We show that LD22 circadian forced desynchrony in rats induces depressive-like phenotypes including anhedonia, sexual dysfunction, and increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST), as well as changes in the levels and turnover rates of monoamines within the prefrontal cortex. Desynchronized rats show increased FST immobility during the dark (active) phase but decreased immobility during the light (rest) phase, suggesting a decrease in the amplitude of the normal daily oscillation in this behavioral manifestation of depression. Our results support the notion that the prolonged internal misalignment of circadian rhythms induced by environmental challenge to the central circadian pacemaker may constitute part of the etiology of depression.},

  abstract = {The mammalian molecular circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regulates locomotor activity rhythms as well as clocks in peripheral tissues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Ko and Takahashi, 2006). Constant light (LL) can induce behavioral and physiological arrhythmicity by desynchronizing clock cells in the SCN (Ohta et al., 2005). We examined how the disordered clock cells resynchronize by probing the molecular clock and measuring behavior in mice transferred from LL to constant darkness (DD). The circadian locomotor activity rhythms disrupted in LL become robustly rhythmic again from the beginning of DD, and the starting phase of the rhythm in DD is specific, not random, suggesting that the desynchronized clock cells are quickly reset in an unconventional manner by the L/D transition. By measuring mPERIOD protein rhythms, we showed that the SCN and peripheral tissue clocks quickly become rhythmic again in phase with the behavioral rhythms. We propose that this resetting mechanism may be different from conventional phase shifting, which involves light induction of Period genes (Albrecht et al., 1997; Shearman et al., 1997; Shigeyoshi et al., 1997). Using our functional insights, we could shift the circadian phase of locomotor activity rhythms by 12 h using a 15 h LL treatment: essentially producing phase reversal by a single light pulse, a feat that has not been reported previously in wild-type mice and that has potential clinical utility.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms in behavior, metabolism, and physiology are based upon transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a core set of clock genes that interact to regulate their own expression. In mammals, the SCN is the site of a master biological clock regulating circadian locomotor rhythms. The products of the clock genes mPer1, mPer2, mCry1, and mCry2 form essential components of both negative and positive elements within the SCN oscillator. The primary aims of this study were to examine clock gene abundance under longterm LL in an attempt to provide molecular correlates of the lengthened tau and daily phase delays described by Aschoff's rule. Wheel-running behavior was recorded from mice maintained in either DD or LL for 50 days. The abundance of the clock genes mPer1, mPer2, mCry1, and mCry2 and their protein products was then examined (every approximately 4 h) within the SCN using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Under LL conditions, mPer1, mPer2, mCry1, and mCry2 messages remained rhythmic, although the waveform of mCry2 was altered compared to DD. In LL, mPER1, mCRY1, and mCRY2 protein levels were also rhythmic and comparable to the patterns observed in DD. However, mPER2 is elevated and constitutively expressed under LL. Thus, rhythmic expression of these clock genes is not dependent on the rhythmic production of mPER2, and the acute up-regulation of mPer1 and mPer2 described for short (nonparametric) light pulses is not sustained under LL conditions. These findings suggest that mPER2 is important for the generation of phase delays in the molecular clockwork, providing a possible molecular explanation for Aschoff's rule: LL lengthens the circadian period by inhibiting the degeneration of mPER2, and constitutively elevated levels of mPER2 enhance the phase-delaying limb of the molecular oscillator.},

We subjected male C57Bl/6J mice to constant light [12-h light-light (LL) cycle] to examine the effects of a disturbed circadian rhythm on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the central pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) revealed an immediate reduction in rhythm amplitude, stabilizing at 44\% of normal amplitude values after 4 d LL. Food intake was increased (+26\%) and energy expenditure decreased (-13\%), and we observed immediate body weight gain (d 4: +2.4\%, d 14: +5.0\%). Mixed model analysis revealed that weight gain developed more rapidly in response to LL as compared to high fat. After 4 wk in LL, the circadian pattern in feeding and energy expenditure was completely lost, despite continuing low-amplitude rhythms in the SCN and in behavior, whereas weight gain had stabilized. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis revealed complete abolishment of normal circadian variation in insulin sensitivity in LL. In conclusion, a reduction in amplitude of the SCN, to values previously observed in aged mice, is sufficient to induce a complete loss of circadian rhythms in energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity.},

This conclusion is based on averaged data from groups of experimental animals sacrificed at each time point. To investigate the effect of LL housing on the peripheral clocks of individual mice, an in vivo imaging system was used to observe the circadian bioluminescence rhythm in peripheral tissues of the liver, kidney, and submandibular salivary gland in PER2::LUCIFERASE knock-in mice. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the majority of individual peripheral tissues still had rhythmic oscillations of their circadian clocks in LL conditions. However, LL housing caused decreased amplitudes and a broad distribution of peak phases in PER2::LUCIFERASE oscillations irrespective of the state of the animals' behavioral rhythmicity. Because both scheduled feeding and scheduled exercise are effective recovery stimuli for circadian clock deficits, we examined whether scheduled feeding or scheduled exercise could reverse this impairment. The results showed that scheduled feeding or exercise could not restore the amplitude of peripheral clocks in LL. On the other hand, the LL-induced broad phase distribution was reversed, and peak phases were entrained to a specific time point by scheduled feeding but only slightly by scheduled exercise. The present results demonstrate that LL housing impairs peripheral circadian clock oscillations by altering both amplitude and phase in individual mice. The broad distribution of clock phases was clearly reversed by scheduled feeding, suggesting the importance of scheduled feeding as an entraining stimulus for impaired peripheral clocks.},

However, recent work has demonstrated that the SCN and peripheral tissues generate independent circadian oscillations in Per1 clock gene expression in vitro. In the present study, we sought to clarify the role of the SCN in the intact system by recording rhythms in clock gene expression in vivo. A practical imaging protocol was developed that enables us to measure circadian rhythms easily, noninvasively, and longitudinally in individual mice. Circadian oscillations were detected in the kidney, liver, and submandibular gland studied in about half of the SCN-lesioned, behaviorally arrhythmic mice. However, their amplitude was decreased in these organs. Free-running periods of peripheral clocks were identical to those of activity rhythms recorded before the SCN lesion. Thus, we can report for the first time that many of the fundamental properties of circadian oscillations in peripheral clocks in vivo are maintained in the absence of SCN control.},

Among the criteria of validation, prolactin was identified in urine by Western blot whereas both prolactin and corticosterone levels were undetectable in the urine of hypophysectomized rats. The determination of prolactin and corticosterone levels on serial urine samples showed daily variations in male rats entrained by the light-dark cycle. The acrophases of the 24-hour prolactin and corticosterone profiles were located at 03:26 h and 23:32 h respectively, a delay of 3-4 hours compared with the values of the 24-hour plasma profiles reported in the literature. Corticosterone and prolactin rhythms were abolished or dramatically delayed after 3 weeks of constant illumination. As expected, constant light suppressed the rhythm of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the major hepatic metabolite of melatonin.

  abstract = {Individuals are increasingly exposed to light at night. Exposure to constant light (LL) disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, body temperature, hormones, and the sleep-wake cycle in animals. Other behavioural responses to LL have been reported, but are inconsistent. The present experiment sought to determine whether LL produces changes in affective responses and whether behavioural changes are mediated by alterations in glucocorticoid concentrations. Relative to conspecifics maintained in a light/dark cycle (LD, 16:8 light/dark), male Swiss-Webster mice exposed to LL for three weeks increased depressive-like behavioural responses as evaluated by the forced swim test and sucrose anhedonia. Furthermore, providing a light escape tube reversed the effects of LL in the forced swim test. LL mice displayed reduced anxiety as evaluated by the open field and elevated-plus maze. Glucocorticoid concentrations were reduced in the LL group suggesting that the affective behavioural responses to LL are not the result of elevated corticosterone. Additionally, mice housed in LD with a clear tube displayed increased paired testes mass as compared to LL mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that exposure to unnatural lighting can induce significant changes in affect, increasing depressive-like and decreasing anxiety-like responses.},

  issn = {0006-3223},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examines the effects of long-term continuous exposure to light on dopaminergic supersensitivity induced by repeated treatment with haloperidol in rats.
METHODS: Spontaneous general activity in an open-field (SGA) and stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine (SB-APO) or amphetamine (SB-AMP) were used as experimental parameters. Rats were allocated to four groups in each experiment: saline-treated animals kept under a 12-hour light/dark cycle (LD) or 24-hour light/light cycle (LL), and 2 mg/kg haloperidol-treated animals kept under the above cycles. Plasma corticosterone concentration was also measured by radioimmunoassay in saline-treated rats kept under a LD or LL cycle.
RESULTS: All the behavioral parameters used showed the development of central dopaminergic supersensitivity in rats kept under both cycles. Continuous exposure to light enhanced SGA and SB-AMP in both saline- and haloperidol-treated rats, but did not modify SB-APO. Animals kept under the LL cycle presented an increased plasma corticosterone concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that continuous exposure to light leads to an increase in dopaminergic function in both normal and "supersensitive" rats. This effect seems to be mediated by a presynaptic mechanism possibly involving corticosterone actions.},

  abstract = {The global increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders coincides with the increase of exposure to light at night (LAN) and shift work. Circadian regulation of energy homeostasis is controlled by an endogenous biological clock that is synchronized by light information. To promote optimal adaptive functioning, the circadian clock prepares individuals for predictable events such as food availability and sleep, and disruption of clock function causes circadian and metabolic disturbances. To determine whether a causal relationship exists between nighttime light exposure and obesity, we examined the effects of LAN on body mass in male mice. Mice housed in either bright (LL) or dim (DM) LAN have significantly increased body mass and reduced glucose tolerance compared with mice in a standard (LD) light/dark cycle, despite equivalent levels of caloric intake and total daily activity output. Furthermore, the timing of food consumption by DM and LL mice differs from that in LD mice. Nocturnal rodents typically eat substantially more food at night; however, DM mice consume 55.5\% of their food during the light phase, as compared with 36.5\% in LD mice. Restricting food consumption to the active phase in DM mice prevents body mass gain. These results suggest that low levels of light at night disrupt the timing of food intake and other metabolic signals, leading to excess weight gain. These data are relevant to the coincidence between increasing use of light at night and obesity in humans.},

The present study explored in rats the effects of circadian disruption by constant light on behavioral and hormonal indicators of a depressive-like condition and on the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Exposure to constant light for 8 weeks resulted in loss of circadian patterns of spontaneous general activity, melatonin and corticosterone. Moreover these rats exhibited anhedonia in a sucrose consumption test, and increased grooming in the open-field test, which reflects an anxiety-like condition. In the SCN decreased cellular activation was observed by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. In rats exposed to constant darkness, circadian behavioral and hormonal patterns remained conserved, however mild depressive-like indicators were observed in the anhedonia test and mild anxiety-like behaviors were observed in the open field test. Data indicate that chronic conditions of LL or DD are both disruptive for the activity of the SCN leading to depression- and anxiety-like behavior. Present results point out the main role played by the biological clock and the risk of altered photoperiods on affective behavior.},

  abstract = {Various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, are comorbid with sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions. To understand the links between circadian rhythms and schizophrenia, we analyzed wheel-running behavior of Sandy (Sdy) mice, which have a loss-of-function mutation in the schizophrenia risk gene Dtnbp1, and exhibit several behavioral features of schizophrenia. While rhythms of Sdy mice were mainly normal under light-dark conditions (LD) or in constant darkness (DD), they had a significantly longer free-running period under constant light (LL) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The mutant mice also had a higher subjective day/subjective night ratio of activity under LL, indicating lower amplitude, and a lower precision of their onsets of activity under all three lighting conditions. These observations are reminiscent of the circadian disruptions observed in schizophrenia patients. This prompted us to assess schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities in Sdy mice following alteration of the circadian rhythms by presentation of constant light. Spontaneous locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and anxiety-like behavior were assessed under baseline LD conditions, then in LL, and then again in LD. Under LL, the Sdy mice showed significantly increased spontaneous locomotion as well as deficits in PPI compared to WT mice. Strikingly, these behavioral deficits persisted even after the mice were returned in LD conditions. While LL led to an increase in anxiety-like behavior in WT animals that was fully reversed after 3 weeks in LD, this effect was not observed in the Sdy mutants. Overall, these results suggest that Dtnbp1 deficiency may lead to increased vulnerability to schizophrenia under environmental conditions where circadian rhythms are altered.},

  abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathways have critical roles in the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. We found that extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 MAPK phosphorylation and cAMP underwent a circadian oscillation in the hippocampus that was paralleled by changes in Ras activity and the phosphorylation of MAPK kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The nadir of this activation cycle corresponded with severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning under both light-dark and free-running conditions. Circadian oscillations in cAMP and MAPK activity were absent in memory-deficient transgenic mice that lacked Ca2+ -stimulated adenylyl cyclases. Furthermore, physiological and pharmacological interference with oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation after the cellular memory consolidation period impaired the persistence of hippocampus-dependent memory. These data suggest that the persistence of long-term memories may depend on reactivation of the cAMP/MAPK/CREB transcriptional pathway in the hippocampus during the circadian cycle.},

This retrograde amnesia induced by phase-shifting lasted at least 2 days, and gradually diminished the longer the rats were exposed to the new illumination cycle. Retention performance was not impaired when rats were exposed to phase-shifting for 3-5 days before the learning trial. The retrograde amnesia due to changing the illumination cycle is probably due to retrieval disturbances. Extinction of active avoidance behavior was facilitated in rats exposed to a phase-shifted illumination cycle, but social and explorative behavior of rats tested in dyadic encounters were not affected by changing the normal illumination cycle. It is concluded that phase-shifting may result in amnesia for newly learned behavioral responses, but not for more innate behavioral patterns.},

In the hippocampus, neurogenesis, which continues to occur throughout life, has been reported to exhibit circadian variation under cyclic light-dark conditions. In the present study, we examined whether a constant light environment affected hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Half of the animals were exposed to continuous light conditions (L/L group), while the other half remained under normal cyclic light-dark conditions (L/D group). In the L/L group, the number of BrdU-labeled cells (proliferating cells) and that of BrdU and class III β-tubulin double-labeled cells (newborn neurons) in the granule cell layer were significantly decreased compared with the L/D group. Because hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in memory and learning, we also investigated the effects on performance in water maze tasks to assess spatial learning. Exposure to L/L treatment for 3 weeks impaired spatial learning task performance, although there was no difference in the open field behaviors between the groups. These findings demonstrate that the constant light conditions impaired hippocampal neurogenesis as well as cognitive performance, and suggest an important role for the cyclic light-dark environment in appropriate maintenance of the hippocampal system.},

To investigate the role of melatonin deficiency in AD, we used constant illumination to interrupt melatonin metabolism and measured some of the AD-like alterations in rats. Concomitant with decreased serum melatonin, the rats developed spatial memory deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple sites, activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and protein kinase A, as well as suppression of protein phosphatase-1. Prominent oxidative damage and organelle lesions, demonstrated by increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins including BiP/GRP78 and CHOP/GADD153, decreased number of rough ER and free ribosome, thinner synapses, and increased superoxide dismutase and monoamine oxidase were also observed in the light exposed rats. Simultaneous supplement of melatonin partially arrested the behavioral and molecular impairments. It is suggested that melatonin deficiency may be an upstream effector responsible for the AD-like behavioral and molecular pathologies with ER stress-involved mechanisms.},

Since hippocampus is sensitive to stress, which facilitates long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 area, we examined whether CCL exposure influenced hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in Wistar rats. Here we report that CCL exposure (3 weeks) disrupted 24-h cycle of locomotion activity in open field test. These rats showed shorter escape latency during initial phase of spatial learning but impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory without affecting the visual platform learning task in Morris water maze (MWM) compared with control rats. This effect may be due to stress adaptation as reflected by reduced thigmotaxis and anxiety-like behaviors in CCL rats. Moreover, in CA1 area of the hippocampal slices, CCL rats failed to show LTD by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses, 1 Hz), while showed decreased short-term depression compared with control rats indicating the induction of LTD was influenced by CCL exposure. Furthermore, additional acute stress enabled LFS to induce LTD in control rats but not in CCL rats. Thus, these results suggested that CCL exposure impaired spatial memory and influenced hippocampal LTD, which may be due to stress adaptation.},

Memory was evaluated by the time spent in the aversive enclosed arm, anxiety was evaluated by the time spent in the open arms and locomotor behavior was evaluated by number of entries in the arms of the maze. The results showed that long-term (35-42 days) continuous light exposure did not modify memory or anxiety parameters but increased locomotor activity. While the increase in locomotor behavior is in line with previous studies, the unexpected absence of alterations in memory and anxiety (reported to be influenced by the circadian rhythm) is discussed.},

  abstract = {Temporal perception is fundamental to environmental adaptation in humans and other animals. To deal with timing and time perception, organisms have developed multiple systems that are active over a broad range of order of magnitude, the most important being circadian timing, interval timing and millisecond timing. The circadian pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and is driven by a self-sustaining oscillator with a period close to 24h. Time estimation in the second-to-minutes range--known as interval timing--involves the interaction of the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex. In this work we tested the hypothesis that interval timing in mice is sensitive to circadian modulations. Animals were trained following the peak-interval (PI) procedure. Results show significant differences in the estimation of 24-second intervals at different times of day, with a higher accuracy in the group trained at night, which were maintained under constant dark (DD) conditions. Interval timing was also studied in animals under constant light (LL) conditions, which abolish circadian rhythmicity. Mice under LL conditions were unable to acquire temporal control in the peak interval procedure. Moreover, short time estimation in animals subjected to circadian desynchronizations (modeling jet lag-like situations) was also affected. Taken together, our results indicate that short-time estimation is modulated by the circadian clock.},

To investigate the organization of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues. We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control, which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental light cycle.},

  abstract = {Jet lag encompasses a range of psycho- and physiopathological symptoms that arise from temporal misalignment of the endogenous circadian clock with external time. Repeated jet lag exposure, encountered by business travelers and airline personnel as well as shift workers, has been correlated with immune deficiency, mood disorders, elevated cancer risk, and anatomical anomalies of the forebrain. Here, we have characterized the molecular response of the mouse circadian system in an established experimental paradigm for jet lag whereby mice entrained to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle undergo light phase advancement by 6 hours. Unexpectedly, strong heterogeneity of entrainment kinetics was found not only between different organs, but also within the molecular clockwork of each tissue. Manipulation of the adrenal circadian clock, in particular phase-shifting of adrenal glucocorticoid rhythms, regulated the speed of behavioral reentrainment. Blocking adrenal corticosterone either prolonged or shortened jet lag, depending on the time of administration. This key role of adrenal glucocorticoid phasing for resetting of the circadian system provides what we believe to be a novel mechanism-based approach for possible therapies for jet lag and jet lag-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms govern many aspects of physiology and behavior including cognitive processes. Components of neural circuits involved in learning and memory, e.g., the amygdala and the hippocampus, exhibit circadian rhythms in gene expression and signaling pathways. The functional significance of these rhythms is still not understood. In the present study, we sought to determine the impact of transiently disrupting the circadian system by shifting the light/dark (LD) cycle. Such "jet lag" treatments alter daily rhythms of gene expression that underlie circadian oscillations as well as disrupt the synchrony between the multiple oscillators found within the body.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We subjected adult male C57Bl/6 mice to a contextual fear conditioning protocol either before or after acute phase shifts of the LD cycle. As part of this study, we examined the impact of phase advances and phase delays, and the effects of different magnitudes of phase shifts. Under all conditions tested, we found that recall of fear conditioned behavior was specifically affected by the jet lag. We found that phase shifts potentiated the stress-evoked corticosterone response without altering baseline levels of this hormone. The jet lag treatment did not result in overall sleep deprivation, but altered the temporal distribution of sleep. Finally, we found that prior experience of jet lag helps to compensate for the reduced recall due to acute phase shifts.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Acute changes to the LD cycle affect the recall of fear-conditioned behavior. This suggests that a synchronized circadian system may be broadly important for normal cognition and that the consolidation of memories may be particularly sensitive to disruptions of circadian timing.},

Here, we examined sleep/wake dynamics during chronic exposure to environmental circadian disruption (ECD), and if chronic partial sleep loss associated with ECD influences the induction of shift-related inflammatory disorder. Sleep and wakefulness were telemetrically recorded across three months of ECD, in which the dark-phase of a light-dark cycle was advanced weekly by 6 h. A three month regimen of ECD caused a temporary reorganization of sleep (NREM and REM) and wake processes across each week, resulting in an approximately 10\% net loss of sleep each week relative to baseline levels. A separate group of mice were subjected to ECD or a regimen of imposed wakefulness (IW) aimed to mimic sleep amounts under ECD for one month. Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) was quantified in sleep-wake regulatory areas: the nucleus accumbens (NAc), basal forebrain (BF), and medial preoptic area (MnPO). To assess the inflammatory response, trunk blood was treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent release of IL-6 was measured. Fos-IR was greatest in the NAc, BF, and MnPO of mice subjected to IW. The inflammatory response to LPS was elevated in mice subjected to ECD, but not mice subjected to IW. Thus, the net sleep loss that occurs under ECD is not associated with a pathological immune response.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms modulate nearly every mammalian physiological process. Chronic disruption of circadian timing in shift work or during chronic jet lag in animal models leads to a higher risk of several pathologies. Many of these conditions in both shift workers and experimental models share the common risk factor of inflammation. In this study, we show that experimentally induced circadian disruption altered innate immune responses. Endotoxemic shock induced by LPS was magnified, leading to hypothermia and death after four consecutive weekly 6-h phase advances of the light/dark schedule, with 89\% mortality compared with 21\% in unshifted control mice. This may be due to a heightened release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS treatment in shifted animals. Isolated peritoneal macrophages harvested from shifted mice exhibited a similarly heightened response to LPS in vitro, indicating that these cells are a target for jet lag. Sleep deprivation and stress are known to alter immune function and are potential mediators of the effects we describe. However, polysomnographic recording in mice exposed to the shifting schedule revealed no sleep loss, and stress measures were not altered in shifted mice. In contrast, we observed altered or abolished rhythms in the expression of clock genes in the central clock, liver, thymus, and peritoneal macrophages in mice after chronic jet lag. We conclude that circadian disruption, but not sleep loss or stress, are associated with jet lag-related dysregulation of the innate immune system. Such immune changes might be a common mechanism for the myriad negative health effects of shift work.},

  abstract = {Disruption of circadian rhythm can impair long-term passive avoidance memory of rats and mice. The present study investigated whether disruption of circadian rhythm can also impair social memory of male rats. Social memory was assessed using the social discrimination test, in which a short-term olfactory memory is formed by social interaction with a juvenile rat during a learning trial. After an intertrial interval, a retrieval trial is performed, in which social memory is expressed as a decreased attention paid to the same juvenile as compared to a new juvenile. First, the social memory at four different time points across the light-dark cycle was measured with an intertrial interval of 10 or 25 min. There was no significant circadian variation of social memory across the light-dark cycle. Subsequently, the effect of a -6 or 12-h phase shift on social memory was studied. These phase shifts were previously found to impair long-term passive avoidance memory. However, no effect of either phase shift was observed in the social discrimination test. It is concluded that the disruption of circadian rhythm had no effect on the social memory of rats. Differences between short-term social memory and long-term passive avoidance memory are discussed in relation to their apparent differential susceptibility to the effects of circadian rhythm disruption.},

Despite anecdotal and correlational reports suggesting a negative impact of circadian disruptions on brain function, this possibility has not been experimentally examined. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we investigated whether experimental ‘jet lag’ (i.e., phase advances of the light∶dark cycle) negatively impacts learning and memory and whether any deficits observed are associated with reductions in hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Because insults to circadian timing alter circulating glucocorticoid and sex steroid concentrations, both of which influence neurogenesis and learning/memory, we assessed the contribution of these endocrine factors to any observed alterations. Circadian disruption resulted in pronounced deficits in learning and memory paralleled by marked reductions in hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Significantly, deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory were not only seen during the period of the circadian disruption, but also persisted well after the cessation of jet lag, suggesting long-lasting negative consequences on brain function. Conclusions/Significance Together, these findings support the view that circadian disruptions suppress hippocampal neurogenesis via a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism, imposing pronounced and persistent impairments on learning and memory.},

The present experiments assessed the effects of circadian disruption on learning and memory function and various food related processes including diet consumption rates, food metabolism, and changes in body weight. These experiments utilized a novel variant of the conditioned place preference task (CPP) that is normally used to assess Pavlovian associative learning and memory processes produced via repeated context-reward pairings. For the present experiments, the standard CPP paradigm was modified in that both contexts were paired with food, but the dietary constituents of the food were different. In particular, we were interested in whether rats could differentiate between two types of carbohydrates, simple (dextrose) and complex (starch). Consumption rates for each type of carbohydrate were measured throughout training. A test of context preference without the food present was also conducted. At the end of behavioral testing, a fasting glucose test and a glucose challenge test were administered. Chronic photoperiod shifting resulted in impaired context learning and memory processes thought to be mediated by a neural circuit centered on the hippocampus. The results also showed that preferences for the different carbohydrate diets were altered in rats experiencing photoperiod shifting in that they maintained an initial preference for the simple carbohydrate throughout training. Lastly, photoperiod shifting resulted in changes in fasting blood glucose levels and elicited weight gain. These results show that chronic photoperiod shifting, which likely resulted in circadian dysfunction, impairs multiple functions of the brain and/or body in the same individual.},

However, the extent of the functional impacts on previously acquired associations following circadian rhythm re-entrainment is unknown. The impacts of repeated photoperiod shifts on learning and memory in male and female rats were examined. For these experiments, rats were trained on a spatial version of the Morris water task (MWT) and a visual discrimination task designed for the 8-arm radial maze. Following asymptotic performance on these tasks, rats experienced a repeating photoperiod shift procedure and were then re-entrained. Following circadian re-entrainment, retention of pre-photoperiod-shift-acquired associations was tested. In addition, an extra-dimensional set shift was performed using the 8-arm radial maze. Impaired retention of the MWT platform location was observed in photoperiod-shifted subjects relative to subjects with stable, unmanipulated photoperiods. Repeated photoperiod shifts negatively impacted retention in males and females compared with subjects with stable photoperiods. Retention and the ability to detect extra-dimensional shifts on the visual discrimination task were also impaired, though not consistently by sex or photoperiod condition. Running wheel availability was also included in the analyses to determine whether exercise influenced the effects of photoperiod shifting. The absence of a running wheel produced significant declines in memory retention on both MWT and the visual discrimination task, but only for male rats. The observed impairments indicate that multiple neural systems supporting different learning and memory functions are susceptible to circadian disruption, even if the association is acquired prior to rhythm fragmentation and tested following rhythm re-entrainment.},

We demonstrate a significant learning and memory deficit on a spatial version of the water maze task in the chronically phase shifted, but not in the acutely phase shifted animals.

Fourteen subjects participated in a forced desynchrony protocol allowing assessment of the relationship between body temperature and performance while controlling for circadian phase and hours awake. Most neurobehavioral measures varied as a function of internal biological time and duration of wakefulness. A number of performance measures were better when body temperature was elevated, including working memory, subjective alertness, visual attention, and the slowest 10\% of reaction times. These findings demonstrate that an increased body temperature, associated with and independent of internal biological time, is correlated with improved performance and alertness.

  abstract = {We studied locomotor activity rhythms of C57/Bl6 mice under a chronic jet lag (CJL) protocol (ChrA(6/2)               ), which consisted of 6-hour phase advances of the light-dark schedule (LD) every 2 days. Through periodogram analysis, we found 2 components of the activity rhythm: a short-period component (21.01 ± 0.04 h) that was entrained by the LD schedule and a long-period component (24.68 ± 0.26 h). We developed a mathematical model comprising 2 coupled circadian oscillators that was tested experimentally with different CJL schedules. Our simulations suggested that under CJL, the system behaves as if it were under a zeitgeber with a period determined by (24 - [phase shift size/days between shifts]). Desynchronization within the system arises according to whether this effective zeitgeber is inside or outside the range of entrainment of the oscillators. In this sense, ChrA(6/2) is interpreted as a (24 - 6/2 = 21 h) zeitgeber, and simulations predicted the behavior of mice under other CJL schedules with an effective 21-hour zeitgeber. Animals studied under an asymmetric T = 21 h zeitgeber (carried out by a 3-hour shortening of every dark phase) showed 2 activity components as observed under ChrA(6/2): an entrained short-period (21.01 ± 0.03 h) and a long-period component (23.93 ± 0.31 h). Internal desynchronization was lost when mice were subjected to 9-hour advances every 3 days, a possibility also contemplated by the simulations. Simulations also predicted that desynchronization should be less prevalent under delaying than under advancing CJL. Indeed, most mice subjected to 6-hour delay shifts every 2 days (an effective 27-hour zeitgeber) displayed a single entrained activity component (26.92 ± 0.11 h). Our results demonstrate that the disruption provoked by CJL schedules is not dependent on the phase-shift magnitude or the frequency of the shifts separately but on the combination of both, through its ratio and additionally on their absolute values. In this study, we present a novel model of forced desynchronization in mice under a specific CJL schedule; in addition, our model provides theoretical tools for the evaluation of circadian disruption under CJL conditions that are currently used in circadian research.},

  abstract = {Pineal melatonin release exhibits a circadian rhythm with a tight nocturnal pattern. Melatonin synthesis is regulated by the master circadian clock within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is also directly inhibited by light. The SCN is necessary for both circadian regulation and light inhibition of melatonin synthesis and thus it has been difficult to isolate these two regulatory limbs to define the output pathways by which the SCN conveys circadian and light phase information to the pineal. A 22-h light–dark (LD) cycle forced desynchrony protocol leads to the stable dissociation of rhythmic clock gene expression within the ventrolateral SCN (vlSCN) and the dorsomedial SCN (dmSCN). In the present study, we have used this protocol to assess the pattern of melatonin release under forced desynchronization of these SCN subregions. In light of our reported patterns of clock gene expression in the forced desynchronized rat, we propose that the vlSCN oscillator entrains to the 22-h LD cycle whereas the dmSCN shows relative coordination to the light-entrained vlSCN, and that this dual-oscillator configuration accounts for the pattern of melatonin release. We present a simple mathematical model in which the relative coordination of a single oscillator within the dmSCN to a single light-entrained oscillator within the vlSCN faithfully portrays the circadian phase, duration and amplitude of melatonin release under forced desynchronization. Our results underscore the importance of the SCN′s subregional organization to both photic input processing and rhythmic output control.},

  abstract = {AIM: Under natural conditions diurnal rhythms of biological processes of the organism are synchronized with each other and to the environmental changes by means of the circadian system. Disturbances of the latter affect hormonal levels, sleep-wakefulness cycle and cognitive performance. To study mechanisms of such perturbations animal models subjected to artificial photoperiods are often used. The goal of current study was to understand the effects of circadian rhythm disruption, caused by a short light-dark cycle regime, on activity of the cerebral cortex in rodents.
METHODS: We used electroencephalogram to assess the distribution of vigilance states, perform spectral analysis, and estimate the homeostatic sleep drive. In addition, we analyzed spontaneous locomotion of C57BL/6J mice under symmetric, 22-, 21-, and 20-h-long light-dark cycles using video recording and tracking methods.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that shortening of photoperiod caused a significant increase of slow wave activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep suggesting an elevation of sleep pressure under such conditions. While the rhythm of spontaneous locomotion was completely entrained by all light-dark cycles tested, periodic changes in the power of the θ- and γ-frequency ranges during wakefulness gradually disappeared under 22- and 21-h-long light-dark cycles. This was associated with a significant increase in the θ-γ phase-amplitude coupling during wakefulness. Our results thus provide deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impairment of learning and memory retention, which is associated with disturbed circadian regulation.},

One group of animals was maintained in a normal 24 h light-dark cycle of 12:12 (T24 group, control). A second group was housed in a 22 h cycle of 11:11 (T22 group, experimental), a condition which is known to produce dissociation of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in two components. Both groups were tested on two memory tasks: passive avoidance and object recognition. An additional control group, kept under constant darkness (DD group), was used for a passive avoidance task. Testing occurred 30 min (short-term memory--STM) and 24 h (T24 and DD group) or 22 h (T22 group) (long-term memory--LTM) after training. The T22 group showed impairment on the passive avoidance task (STM and LTM) compared with the T24 and DD groups. On the object recognition task, the T22 and T24 groups performed similarly in all the sessions. In conclusion, circadian rhythm dissociation induced a performance deficit in the passive avoidance task but had no effect on the object recognition task. We suggest that dissociation of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity may selectively affect some emotional component related to fear and risk evaluation.},

  abstract = {Humans and other organisms have adapted to a 24-h solar cycle in response to life on Earth. The rotation of the planet on its axis and its revolution around the sun cause predictable daily and seasonal patterns in day length. To successfully anticipate and adapt to these patterns in the environment, a variety of biological processes oscillate with a daily rhythm of approximately 24~h in length. These rhythms arise from hierarchally-coupled cellular clocks generated by positive and negative transcription factors of core circadian clock gene expression. From these endogenous cellular clocks, overt rhythms in activity and patterns in hormone secretion and other homeostatic processes emerge. These circadian rhythms in physiology and behaviour can be organised by a variety of cues, although they are most potently entrained by light. In recent history, there has been a major change from naturally-occurring light cycles set by the sun, to artificial and sometimes erratic light cycles determined by the use of electric lighting. Virtually every individual living in an industrialised country experiences light at night (LAN) but, despite its prevalence, the biological effects of such unnatural lighting have not been fully considered. Using female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), we investigated the effects of chronic nightly exposure to dim light on daily rhythms in locomotor activity, serum cortisol concentrations and brain expression of circadian clock proteins (i.e. PER1, PER2, BMAL1). Although locomotor activity remained entrained to the light cycle, the diurnal fluctuation of cortisol concentrations was blunted and the expression patterns of clock proteins in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and hippocampus were altered. These results demonstrate that chronic exposure to dim LAN can dramatically affect fundamental cellular function and emergent physiology.},

  abstract = {Life on earth is entrained to a 24 h solar cycle that synchronizes circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior; light is the most potent entraining cue. In mammals, light is detected by (1) rods and cones, which mediate visual function, and (2) intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which primarily project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus to regulate circadian rhythms. Recent evidence, however, demonstrates that ipRGCs also project to limbic brain regions, suggesting that, through this pathway, light may have a role in cognition and mood. Therefore, it follows that unnatural exposure to light may have negative consequences for mood or behavior. Modern environmental lighting conditions have led to excessive exposure to light at night (LAN), and particularly to blue wavelength lights. We hypothesized that nocturnal light exposure (i.e., dim LAN) would induce depressive responses and alter neuronal structure in hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). If this effect is mediated by ipRGCs, which have reduced sensitivity to red wavelength light, then we predicted that red LAN would have limited effects on brain and behavior compared with shorter wavelengths. Additionally, red LAN would not induce c-Fos activation in the SCN. Our results demonstrate that exposure to LAN influences behavior and neuronal plasticity and that this effect is likely mediated by ipRGCs. Modern sources of LAN that contain blue wavelengths may be particularly disruptive to the circadian system, potentially contributing to altered mood regulation.},

  abstract = {Artificial nighttime illumination has recently become commonplace throughout the world; however, in common with other animals, humans have not evolved in the ecological context of chronic light at night. With prevailing evidence linking the circadian, endocrine, immune, and metabolic systems, understanding these relationships is important to understanding the etiology and progression of several diseases. To eliminate the covariate of sleep disruption in light at night studies, researchers often use nocturnal animals. However, the assumption that light at night does not affect sleep in nocturnal animals remains unspecified. To test the effects of light at night on sleep, we maintained Swiss-Webster mice in standard light/dark (LD) or dim light at night (DLAN) conditions for 8-10 wks and then measured electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) biopotentials via wireless telemetry over the course of two consecutive days to determine differences in sleep timing and homeostasis. Results show no statistical differences in total percent time, number of episodes, maximum or average episode durations in wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No differences were evident in SWS delta power, an index of sleep drive, between groups. Mice kept in DLAN conditions showed a relative increase in REM sleep during the first few hours after the dark/light transition. Both groups displayed normal 24-h circadian rhythms as measured by voluntary running wheel activity. Groups did not differ in body mass, but a marked negative correlation of body mass with percent time spent awake and a positive correlation of body mass with time spent in SWS was evident. Elevated body mass was also associated with shorter maximum wake episode durations, indicating heavier animals had more trouble remaining in the wake vigilance state for extended periods of time. Body mass did not correlate with activity levels, nor did activity levels correlate with time spent in different sleep states. These data indicate that heavier animals tend to sleep more, potentially contributing to further weight gain. We conclude that chronic DLAN exposure does not significantly affect sleep timing or homeostasis in mice, supporting the use of dim light with nocturnal rodents in chronobiology research to eliminate the possible covariate of sleep disruption.},

Light provides the main input to the master clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that coordinates the sleep-wake cycle. We aimed to develop a rodent model for the effects of LAN on sleep. Therefore, we exposed male Wistar rats to either a 12\,h light (150-200lux):12\,h dark (LD) schedule or a 12\,h light (150-200 lux):12\,h dim white light (5 lux) (LDim) schedule. LDim acutely decreased the amplitude of daily rhythms of REM and NREM sleep, with a further decrease over the following days. LDim diminished the rhythms of 1) the circadian 16-19\,Hz frequency domain within the NREM sleep EEG, and 2) SCN clock gene expression. LDim also induced internal desynchronization in locomotor activity by introducing a free running rhythm with a period of \textasciitilde{}25\,h next to the entrained 24\,h rhythm. LDim did not affect body weight or glucose tolerance. In conclusion, we introduce the first rodent model for disturbed circadian control of sleep due to LAN. We show that internal desynchronization is possible in a 24\,h L:D cycle which suggests that a similar desynchronization may explain the association between LAN and human insomnia.},

One environmental change that has coincided with elevated rates of depression is increased exposure to artificial light at night. Shift workers and others chronically exposed to light at night are at increased risk of mood disorders, suggesting that nighttime illumination may influence brain mechanisms mediating affect. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night may impact affective responses and alter morphology of hippocampal neurons. Ovariectomized adult female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) were housed for 8 weeks in either a light/dark cycle (LD) or a light/dim light cycle (DM), and then behavior was assayed. DM-hamsters displayed more depression-like responses in the forced swim and the sucrose anhedonia tests compared with LD-hamsters. Conversely, in the elevated plus maze DM-hamsters reduced anxiety-like behaviors. Brains from the same animals were processed using the Golgi-Cox method and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus were analyzed for morphological characteristics. In CA1, DM-hamsters significantly reduced dendritic spine density on both apical and basilar dendrites, an effect which was not mediated by baseline cortisol, as concentrations were equivalent between groups. These results demonstrate dim light at night is sufficient to reduce synaptic spine connections to CA1. Importantly, the present results suggest that night-time low level illumination, comparable to levels that are pervasive in North America and Europe, may contribute to the increasing prevalence of mood disorders.},

  abstract = {Circadian disruption is a common by-product of modern life. Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [\textasciitilde{}150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [\textasciitilde{}150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal.},

Seasonal fluctuations in light exposure, shift-work, and transmeridian travel are all associated with alterations in mood. These studies implicate fluctuations in environmental lighting in the development of depressive disorders. Here we argue that exposure to light at night (LAN) may be causally linked to depression. Male C3H/HeNHsd mice, which produce nocturnal melatonin, were housed in either a standard light/dark (LD) cycle or exposed to nightly dim (5 lux) LAN (dLAN). After four weeks in lighting conditions mice underwent behavioral testing and hippocampal tissue was collected at the termination of the study for qPCR. Here were report that mice exposed to dLAN increase depressive-like responses in both a sucrose anhedonia and forced swim test. In contrast to findings in diurnal grass rats, dLAN mice perform comparably to mice housed under dark nights in a hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. TNFα and IL1β gene expression do not differ between groups, demonstrating that changes in these pro-inflammatory cytokines do not mediate dLAN induced depressive-like responses in mice. BDNF expression is reduced in the hippocampus of mice exposed to dLAN. These results indicate that low levels of LAN can alter mood in mice. This study along with previous work implicates LAN as a potential factor contributing to depression. Further understanding of the mechanisms through which LAN contributes to changes in mood is important for characterizing and treating depressive disorders.},

In this study, the authors exposed Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) to short light pulses during the dark phase of a 16:8 light-dark (LD) cycle and thus obtained a type VI phase response curve. Light pulses early in the night caused phase delays of the activity onset as well as phase advances of the activity offset, whereas light pulses later in the night resulted in phase advances of the activity offset only. A combination of two 15-min light pulses-the first one given late in the scotophase and the second given early in the dark phase of the following night-led to a strong compression of the activity phase alpha. In 75\% of all animals, daily rhythms were no longer visible after complete alpha compression, and long-term arrhythmicity (up to 145 days) persisted despite continued exposure to an LD cycle. Because three independent output rhythms of the clock (i.e., activity, body temperature, and melatonin rhythms) were equally affected, the authors conclude that overt arrhythmicity was due not merely to disrupted output pathways but to an altered state of the central pacemaker. The authors suggest a qualitative two-oscillator model to explain this phenomenon. Their hypothesis assumes that, due to loose coupling, the pacemaker of Djungarian hamsters can be driven to a state of zero phase difference between the two oscillators, with zero amplitude of their outputs.},

CRs in multiple aspects of immune function are absent in rodents that have been rendered circadian-arrhythmic through various methods. In Siberian hamsters, circadian arrhythmia can be induced by disruptive light treatments (DPS). Here we examined CRs in wound healing, and the effects of circadian disruption on wound healing in DPS-arrhythmic hamsters. Circadian entrained/rhythmic (RHYTH) and behaviorally-arrhythmic (ARR) female hamsters were administered a cutaneous wound either 3 h after light onset (ZT03) or 2 h after dark onset (ZT18); wound size was quantified daily using image analyses. Among RHYTH hamsters, ZT03 wounds healed faster than ZT18 wounds, whereas in ARR hamsters, circadian phase did not affect wound healing. In addition, wounds healed slower in ARR hamsters. The results document a clear CR in wound healing, and indicate that the mere presence of organismal circadian organization enhances this aspect of immune function. Faster wound healing in CR-competent hamsters may be mediated by CR-driven coordination of the temporal order of mechanisms (inflammation, leukocyte trafficking, tissue remodeling) underlying cutaneous wound healing.},

  abstract = {Sleep is regulated by independent yet interacting circadian and homeostatic processes. The present study used a novel approach to study sleep homeostasis in the absence of circadian influences by exposing Siberian hamsters to a simple phase delay of the photocycle to make them arrhythmic. Because these hamsters lacked any circadian organization, their sleep homeostasis could be studied in the absence of circadian interactions. Control animals retained circadian rhythmicity after the phase shift and re-entrained to the phase-shifted photocycle. These animals displayed robust daily sleep-wake rhythms with consolidated sleep during the light phase beginning about 1 h after light onset. This marked sleep-wake pattern was circadian in that it persisted in constant darkness. The distribution of sleep in the arrhythmic hamsters over 24 h was similar to that in the light phase of rhythmic animals. Therefore, daily sleep amounts were higher in arrhythmic animals compared with rhythmic ones. During 2- and 6-h sleep deprivations (SD), it was more difficult to keep arrhythmic hamsters awake than it was for rhythmic hamsters. Because the arrhythmic animals obtained more non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) during the SD, they showed a diminished compensatory response in NREMS EEG slow-wave activity during recovery sleep. When amounts of sleep during the SD were taken into account, there were no differences in sleep homeostasis between experimental and control hamsters. Thus loss of circadian control did not alter the homeostatic response to SD. This supports the view that circadian and homeostatic influences on sleep regulation are independent processes.},

  abstract = {Decades of studies have shown that eliminating circadian rhythms of mammals does not compromise their health or longevity in the laboratory in any obvious way. These observations have raised questions about the functional significance of the mammalian circadian system, but have been difficult to address for lack of an appropriate animal model. Surgical ablation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and clock gene knockouts eliminate rhythms, but also damage adjacent brain regions or cause developmental effects that may impair cognitive or other physiological functions. We developed a method that avoids these problems and eliminates rhythms by noninvasive means in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). The present study evaluated cognitive function in arrhythmic animals by using a hippocampal-dependent learning task. Control hamsters exhibited normal circadian modulation of performance in a delayed novel-object recognition task. By contrast, arrhythmic animals could not discriminate a novel object from a familiar one only 20 or 60 min after training. Memory performance was not related to prior sleep history as sleep manipulations had no effect on performance. The GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazol restored learning without restoring circadian rhythms. We conclude that the circadian system is involved in memory function in a manner that is independent of sleep. Circadian influence on learning may be exerted via cyclic GABA output from the SCN to target sites involved in learning. Arrhythmic hamsters may have failed to perform this task because of chronic inhibitory signaling from the SCN that interfered with the plastic mechanisms that encode learning in the hippocampus.},

An important problem overlooked in these translational models is that human dysrhythmia occurs while SCN circuitry is genetically and neurologically intact. Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) are particularly well suited for translational studies because they can be made arrhythmic by a one-time photic treatment that severely impairs spatial and recognition memory. We found that once animals are made arrhythmic, subsequent SCN ablation completely rescues memory processing. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of a malfunctioning SCN on cognition require preservation of circuitry between the SCN and downstream targets that are lost when these connections are severed.},

Rest-activity rhythm disturbances manifest themselves through a fragmentation of the rhythm, a weak coupling with Zeitgebers, and high levels of activity during the night. The aim of the present study was to investigate which factors contribute to the presence of these disturbances. Therefore, several rest-activity rhythm, constitutional, and environmental variables were assessed in a heterogeneous group of 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease, including presenile and senile patients living at home or in a nursing home, as well as in 11 healthy controls. Circadian rest-activity rhythm disturbances were most prominent in institutionalized patients. Regression analyses showed the involvement of the following variables. First stability of the rest-activity rhythm is associated with high levels of daytime activity and high levels of environmental light resulting from seasonal effects as well as from indoor illumination. Presenile onset contributed to instability of the rhythm. Second, fragmentation of periods of activity and rest is associated with low levels of daytime activity, and is most prominent in moderately severe dementia. Third, night-time activity level is higher during the times of the year when the days are getting shorter and lower when the days are growing longer. These findings indicate that rest-activity rhythm disturbances may improve by increasing environmental light and daytime activity, an assumption for which empirical evidence has recently been published.},

Using a machine learning–based video-tracking technology, we conducted a detailed high-throughput analysis of sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, coupled with a lifelong chronic and specific sleep restriction. Our results show that some wild-type flies are virtually sleepless in baseline conditions and that complete, forced sleep restriction is not necessarily a lethal treatment in wild-type D. melanogaster. We also show that circadian drive, and not homeostatic regulation, is the main contributor to sleep pressure in flies. These results offer a new perspective on the biological role of sleep in Drosophila and, potentially, in other species.
Sleepless fruit flies live, an unexpected finding that provides a new perspective on sleep for this and perhaps other species.

  abstract = {It has often been concluded that subtle, pervasive geophysical stimuli are responsible for the persistence in the laboratory of apparently-spontaneous biological rhythms, i.e. that “biological clocks” have an extrinsic origin. This conclusion rests primarily on the analyses of biological data by procedures related to the classical Buys-Ballot table. When the assumptions necessary for the valid application of these techniques are carefully considered, the claims for persistent accurate geophysical components in biological data prove to have an insufficient logical basis. The periodogram represents a generalization of these same Buys-Ballot methods, but involves less-restrictive assumptions; its usefulness and limitations were explored with artificial data generated by a computer. Following this testing of the analytical method, which served as a kind of empirical “calibration”, the periodogram has been used for a re-examination of some of the original biological data which led to the hypothesis of an extrinsic origin for persistent rhythmicity. These re-analyses indicate that none of 17 examined data sets provides convincing evidence for accurate tidal components (24·8 hours); and that the presence of accurate diurnal components (24·0 hours) represents a reasonable interpretation for only 3 data sets out of 17. Since alternative hypotheses are available which could also account for these (relatively rare) instances of possibly-accurate average diurnal rhythmicities, and since it can reasonably be concluded that accurate tidal rhythmicities are completely absent under laboratory conditions, the arguments in favor of an extrinsic origin for persistent biological rhythms seem to be without any solid foundation in the data on which these arguments have been based.},

Coherence analysis was used to investigate these oscillations in the human sleep electroencephalogram. In all-night electroencephalogram recordings from eight young subjects power and coherence spectra within and between cerebral hemispheres were computed from bipolar derivations placed bilaterally along the antero-posterior axis. The 0.75-50 Hz range was examined with a resolution of 0.25 Hz. Distinct peaks in coherence were present in non-rapid eye movement sleep but not in rapid eye movement sleep. The most prominent and consistent peak was seen in the range of sleep spindles (13-14 Hz), and additional peaks were present in the alpha band (9-10 Hz) and low delta band (1-2 Hz). Whereas coherence in the spindle range was highest in stage 2, the alpha peak was most prominent in slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4). Interhemispheric coherence at 30 Hz was higher in rapid eye movement sleep than in non-rapid eye movement sleep. There were also marked sleep state-independent regional differences. Coherence between homologous interhemispheric derivations was high in the low frequency range and declined with increasing frequencies, whereas coherence of intrahemispheric and non-homologous interhemispheric derivations was at a low level throughout the spectra. It is concluded that coherence analysis may provide insights into large-scale functional connectivities of brain regions during sleep. The high coherence of sleep spindles is an indication for their widespread and quasi-synchronous occurrence throughout the cortex and may point to their specific role in the sleep process.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic "background" 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters--along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth--are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Sleep and/or circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is seen in up to 80\% of schizophrenia patients. The co-morbidity of schizophrenia and SCRD may in part stem from dysfunction in common brain mechanisms, which include the glutamate system, and in particular, the group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGlu2 and mGlu3 (encoded by the genes Grm2 and Grm3). These receptors are relevant to the pathophysiology and potential treatment of schizophrenia, and have also been implicated in sleep and circadian function. In the present study, we characterised the sleep and circadian rhythms of Grm2/3 double knockout (Grm2/3-/-) mice, to provide further evidence for the involvement of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms. We report several novel findings. Firstly, Grm2/3-/- mice demonstrated a decrease in immobility-determined sleep time and an increase in immobility-determined sleep fragmentation. Secondly, Grm2/3-/- mice showed heightened sensitivity to the circadian effects of light, manifested as increased period lengthening in constant light, and greater phase delays in response to nocturnal light pulses. Greater light-induced phase delays were also exhibited by wildtype C57Bl/6J mice following administration of the mGlu2/3 negative allosteric modulator RO4432717. These results confirm the involvement of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors in photic entrainment and sleep regulation pathways. Finally, the diurnal wheel-running rhythms of Grm2/3-/- mice were perturbed under a standard light/dark cycle, but their diurnal rest-activity rhythms were unaltered in cages lacking running wheels, as determined with passive infrared motion detectors. Hence, when assessing the diurnal rest-activity rhythms of mice, the choice of assay can have a major bearing on the results obtained.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) are performed several times on the mean of experimental conditions. When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by α inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

  abstract = {Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption has been widely observed in neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia [1] and often precedes related symptoms [2]. However, mechanistic basis for this association remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the circadian phenotype of blind-drunk (Bdr), a mouse model of synaptosomal-associated protein (Snap)-25 exocytotic disruption that displays schizophrenic endophenotypes modulated by prenatal factors and reversible by antipsychotic treatment [3, 4]. Notably, SNAP-25 has been implicated in schizophrenia from genetic [5-8], pathological [9-13], and functional studies [14-16]. We show here that the rest and activity rhythms of Bdr mice are phase advanced and fragmented under a light/dark cycle, reminiscent of the disturbed sleep patterns observed in schizophrenia. Retinal inputs appear normal in mutants, and clock gene rhythms within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are normally phased both in vitro and in vivo. However, the 24 hr rhythms of arginine vasopressin within the SCN and plasma corticosterone are both markedly phase advanced in Bdr mice. We suggest that the Bdr circadian phenotype arises from a disruption of synaptic connectivity within the SCN that alters critical output signals. Collectively, our data provide a link between disruption of circadian activity cycles and synaptic dysfunction in a model of neuropsychiatric disease.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are approximately 24 h cycles in physiology and behaviour that enable organisms to anticipate predictable rhythmic changes in their environment. These rhythms are a hallmark of normal healthy physiology, and disruption of circadian rhythms has implications for cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular and immune function. Circadian disruption is of increasing concern, and may occur as a result of the pressures of our modern 24/7 society\&mdash;including artificial light exposure, shift-work and jet-lag. In addition, circadian disruption is a common comorbidity in many different conditions, ranging from aging to neurological disorders. A key feature of circadian disruption is the breakdown of robust, reproducible rhythms with increasing fragmentation between activity and rest. Circadian researchers have developed a range of methods for estimating the period of time series, typically based upon periodogram analysis. However, the methods used to quantify circadian disruption across the literature are not consistent. Here we describe a range of different measures that have been used to measure circadian disruption, with a particular focus on laboratory rodent data. These methods include periodogram power, variability in activity onset, light phase activity, activity bouts, interdaily stability, intradaily variability and relative amplitude. The strengths and limitations of these methods are described, as well as their normal ranges and interrelationships. Whilst there is an increasing appreciation of circadian disruption as both a risk to health and a potential therapeutic target, greater consistency in the quantification of disrupted rhythms is needed.},

  abstract = {A three-part study using prolonged nights of sleep was undertaken to verify Broughton's hypothesis of an approximate 12-h ultradrian rhythm of human slow wave sleep (SWS). Part I consisted of 2 8-h adaptation nights followed by a prolonged 15-h night of sleep with bedtime at midnight. A significant return of SWS occurred 12 h and 32 min after the first appearance of SWS. In part II, after 1 adaptation night, subjects were asked to sleep for 15 h but bedtime was delayed until 0400 h. A two-peak return of SWS was observed with a first significant return at 1228 h and a second significant return at 1745 h (i.e., 13 h and 32 min after the first appearance of SWS). In part III, bedtime was again delayed to 0400 h; but subjects were given 3 nights to adapt before the 15 h extended sleep. A single significant return of SWS was then observed at 1656 h, i.e., 12 h and 24 min after the first appearance with no peaks around 1200 h, thus exhibiting the same pattern as in part I. These results suggest that the return of SWS seen normally between 1200 and 1500 h is relatively well entrenched since it remained present in the extended night following sudden bedtime delay. It appears, moreover, that SWS does follow a bimodal 12-h rhythm, which is seen immediately upon extended delayed sleep and can be fully phase-shifted with habituation.},

The slope of this function is reliable within individuals, is significantly less steep in elderly than in young subjects and, in both groups, becomes flatter across successive NREM periods. We interpret these results as consistent with the hypothesis that the function of NREM sleep is to reverse the effects of waking on the brain. According to this model the decreased steepness of slope in the elderly and in later NREM periods reflects the diminishing intensity of these processes. Whatever the correct interpretation, the within-subject consistency of slope values permits their empirical study as a function of experimental manipulations. In addition, the quantitative F-A function established here (A = c/Fb) sets constraints that may prove useful for physiologic models of EEG waves during sleep.},

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2513-17.2018},
  abstract = {Healthy aging is associated with marked effects on sleep, including its daily amount and architecture, as well as the specific EEG oscillations. Neither the neurophysiological underpinnings nor the biological significance of these changes are understood, and crucially the question remains whether aging is associated with reduced sleep need or a diminished capacity to generate sufficient sleep. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging may affect local cortical networks, disrupting the capacity to generate and sustain sleep oscillations, and with it the local homeostatic response to sleep loss. We performed chronic recordings of cortical neural activity and local field potentials from the motor cortex in young and older male C57BL/6J mice, during spontaneous waking and sleep, as well as during sleep after sleep deprivation. In older animals, we observed an increase in the incidence of non-rapid eye movement sleep local field potential slow waves and their associated neuronal silent (OFF) periods, whereas the overall pattern of state-dependent cortical neuronal firing was generally similar between ages. Furthermore, we observed that the response to sleep deprivation at the level of local cortical network activity was not affected by aging. Our data thus suggest that the local cortical neural dynamics and local sleep homeostatic mechanisms, at least in the motor cortex, are not impaired during healthy senescence in mice. This indicates that powerful protective or compensatory mechanisms may exist to maintain neuronal function stable across the life span, counteracting global changes in sleep amount and architecture.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The biological significance of age-dependent changes in sleep is unknown but may reflect either a diminished sleep need or a reduced capacity to generate deep sleep stages. As aging has been linked to profound disruptions in cortical sleep oscillations and because sleep need is reflected in specific patterns of cortical activity, we performed chronic electrophysiological recordings of cortical neural activity during waking, sleep, and after sleep deprivation from young and older mice. We found that all main hallmarks of cortical activity during spontaneous sleep and recovery sleep after sleep deprivation were largely intact in older mice, suggesting that the well-described age-related changes in global sleep are unlikely to arise from a disruption of local network dynamics within the neocortex.},

The data of recently published positive and negative reports on the effect of bright light on actigraphically assessed rest-activity rhythms in demented elderly were reanalyzed using several statistical procedures. It was demonstrated that the light-induced improvement in coupling of the rest-activity rhythm to the environmental zeitgeber of bright light is better detected using nonparametric procedures. Cosinor, complex demodulation, and Lomb-Scargle periodogram-derived variables are much less sensitive to this effect because of the highly nonsinusoidal waveform of the rest-activity rhythm. Guidelines for analyses of actigraphic data are given to improve the sensitivity to treatment effects in future studies.},

Young and old volunteers showed no differences in their rest- activity rhythm in any of the variables studied. Comparison of old controls versus AD patients revealed that (1) rest-activity rhythm was markedly disturbed in many of the AD patients and tended to be correlated with the severity of the dementia; (2) disturbances were most pronounced in subjects using sedating drugs; (3) disturbances in the latter group did not result from medication as no differences were found in the rest-activity patterns before and after administration of sedating drugs; (4) negative findings reported in the literature concerning circadian disturbances in AD may well have resulted from selection criteria that excluded the group of patients with the most severely affected rest- activity rhythm; and (5) rest-activity monitors offer a practical and fruitful approach for the study of circadian rhythms in humans.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In old age, the circadian timing system loses optimal functioning. This process is even accelerated in Alzheimer's disease. Because pharmacological treatment of day-night rhythm disturbances usually is not very effective and may have considerable side effects, nonpharmacological treatments deserve attention. Bright light therapy has been shown to be effective. It is known from animal studies that increased activity, or an associated process, also strongly affects the circadian timing system, and the present study addresses the question of whether an increased level of physical activity may improve circadian rhythms in elderly. In the study, 10 healthy elderly males were admitted to a fitness training program for 3 months. The circadian rest-activity rhythm was assessed by means of actigraphy before and after the training period and again 1 year after discontinuation. As a control for possible seasonal effects, repeated actigraphic recordings were performed during the same times of the year as were the pre and post measurements in a control group of 8 healthy elderly males. Fitness training induced a significant reduction in the fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm. Moreover, the fragmentation of the rhythm was negatively correlated with the level of fitness achieved after the training. No seasonal effect was found. Previous findings in human and animal studies are reviewed, and several possible mechanisms involved in the effect of fitness training on circadian rhythms are discussed. The results suggest that fitness training may be helpful in elderly people suffering from sleep problems related to circadian rhythm disturbances.},

Telomere length is a result of combined effect of oxidative stress, inflammation and repeated cell replication on it, and thus forming an association between telomere length and chronological aging and related diseases. Thus, decrease in telomere length was found to be important in determining both, the variations in longevity and age-related diseases in an individual. Ongoing and progressive research in the field of telomere length dynamics has proved that aging and age-related diseases apart from having a synergistic effect on telomere length were also found to effect telomere length independently also.

Significant temporal coherence was observed in quintets: the proportion of quintets (4/7), but not pairs (2/8), that became synchronized was greater than could be achieved by the complete simulated reassortment of all individuals. We speculate that the social coupling of individual circadian clocks of group members may be adaptive under certain conditions, and we propose that optimal group sizes in nature may depend not only on species-specific energetics, spatial behaviour and natural history but also on the mathematics of synchronizing assemblies of weakly coupled animal oscillators.},

  shorttitle = {On the Cause of Sleep},
  abstract = {The molecular-level cause of sleep is unknown. In 2012, we suggested that the cause of sleep stems from cumulative effects of numerous intracellular and extracellular protein fragments. According to the fragment generation (FG) hypothesis, protein fragments (which are continually produced through nonprocessive cleavages by intracellular, intramembrane, and extracellular proteases) can be beneficial but toxic as well, and some fragments are eliminated slowly during wakefulness. We consider the FG hypothesis and propose that, during wakefulness, the degradation of accumulating fragments is delayed within natural protein aggregates such as postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in excitatory synapses and in other dense protein meshworks, owing to an impeded diffusion of the ∼3,000-kDa 26S proteasome. We also propose that a major function of sleep involves a partial and reversible expansion of PSDs, allowing an accelerated destruction of PSD-localized fragments by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Expansion of PSDs would alter electrochemistry of synapses, thereby contributing to a decreased neuronal firing during sleep. If so, the loss of consciousness, a feature of sleep, would be the consequence of molecular processes (expansions of protein meshworks) that are required for degradation of protein fragments. We consider the concept of FG sentinels, which signal to sleep-regulating circuits that the levels of fragments are going up. Also discussed is the possibility that protein fragments, which are known to be overproduced during an epileptic seizure, may contribute to postictal sleep and termination of seizures. These and related suggestions, described in the paper, are compatible with current evidence about sleep and lead to testable predictions.},

  volume = {20},
  issn = {0161-8105},
  abstract = {Sleep curtailment constitutes an increasingly common condition in industrialized societies and is thought to affect mood and performance rather than physiological functions. There is no evidence for prolonged or delayed effects of sleep loss on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We evaluated the effects of acute partial or total sleep deprivation on the nighttime and daytime profile of cortisol levels. Plasma cortisol profiles were determined during a 32-hour period (from 1800 hours on day 1 until 0200 hours on day 3) in normal young men submitted to three different protocols: normal sleep schedule (2300-0700 hours), partial sleep deprivation (0400-0800 hours), and total sleep deprivation. Alterations in cortisol levels could only be demonstrated in the evening following the night of sleep deprivation. After normal sleep, plasma cortisol levels over the 1800-2300-hour period were similar on days 1 and 2. After partial and total sleep deprivation, plasma cortisol levels over the 1800-2300-hour period were higher on day 2 than on day 1 (37 and 45\% increases, p = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively), and the onset of the quiescent period of cortisol secretion was delayed by at least 1 hour. We conclude that even partial acute sleep loss delays the recovery of the HPA from early morning circadian stimulation and is thus likely to involve an alteration in negative glucocorticoid feedback regulation. Sleep loss could thus affect the resiliency of the stress response and may accelerate the development of metabolic and cognitive consequences of glucocorticoid excess.},

Today, humans spend hours per day exposed to intermediate light intensities (30–300 lux), particularly in the evening. Interindividual differences in sensitivity to evening light in this intensity range could therefore represent a source of vulnerability to circadian disruption by modern lighting. We characterized individual-level dose–response curves to light-induced melatonin suppression using a within-subjects protocol. Fifty-five participants (aged 18–30) were exposed to a dim control ({$<$}1 lux) and a range of experimental light levels (10–2,000 lux for 5 h) in the evening. Melatonin suppression was determined for each light level, and the effective dose for 50\% suppression (ED50) was computed at individual and group levels. The group-level fitted ED50 was 24.60 lux, indicating that the circadian system is highly sensitive to evening light at typical indoor levels. Light intensities of 10, 30, and 50 lux resulted in later apparent melatonin onsets by 22, 77, and 109 min, respectively. Individual-level ED50 values ranged by over an order of magnitude (6 lux in the most sensitive individual, 350 lux in the least sensitive individual), with a 26\% coefficient of variation. These findings demonstrate that the same evening-light environment is registered by the circadian system very differently between individuals. This interindividual variability may be an important factor for determining the circadian clock’s role in human health and disease.},

  abstract = {Summary
A crucial step in understanding the sleep-control mechanism is to identify sleep neurons. Through systematic anatomical screening followed by functional testing, we identified two sleep-promoting neuronal populations along a thalamo-amygdala pathway, both expressing neurotensin (NTS). Rabies-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing identified the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) as a major source of GABAergic inputs to multiple wake-promoting populations; gene profiling revealed NTS as a prominent marker for these CeA neurons. Optogenetic activation and inactivation of NTS-expressing CeA neurons promoted and suppressed non-REM (NREM) sleep, respectively, and optrode recording showed they are sleep active. Further tracing showed that CeA GABAergic NTS neurons are innervated by glutamatergic NTS neurons in a posterior thalamic region, which also promote NREM sleep. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NTS knockdown in either the thalamic or CeA neurons greatly reduced their sleep-promoting effect. These results reveal a novel thalamo-amygdala circuit for sleep generation in which NTS signaling is essential for both the upstream glutamatergic and downstream GABAergic neurons.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.01.034},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The well established correlation between intima-media thickness (IMT) and the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death is usually measured in subjects with multiple vascular risk factors, which makes it difficult, after application of the usual analysis-of-variance linear combination of effects model, to establish whether each cardiovascular risk factor has, per se, an effect on IMT.
METHOD AND RESULTS: In this study we investigated five "pure" groups of patients (865), i.e. each presenting only one of the following risk factors: hypertension, obesity, overweight, smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and a control group of 37 healthy subjects. We measured, both as discrete and as continuous variables, the following indices: intima-media thickening of the common carotid artery (IMT(C)) and of the common femoral artery (IMT(F)) and the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the prevalence of pathological values for the three indices in the different groups. Subsequently the entire group of 902 subjects was included in a correlation analysis in which the Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair of variables was computed. In order to assign the risk factors a continuous ranking, and obtain a more general idea of the correlation structure, principal component analysis (PCA) was used. The scores obtained from PCA made it possible to build a scale of severity of the vascular risk factors considered. All the risk factors considered were demonstrated to strongly affect the studied indices. Overweight was shown to be the least important risk factor with regard to intima-media thickening, followed by smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and finally obesity, which emerged as the greatest risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The strong correlation between the indices made it possible to compute a composite general score, which provides an univocal risk estimation at single-patient level. IMT(F) was demonstrated to be the most sensitive descriptor. The construction of this risk scale has implications for preventive treatment and the frequency of instrumental examinations, allowing clear quantitative definition of the extent of the damage.},

  abstract = {A single phase advance of the light:dark (LD) cycle can temporarily disrupt synchrony of neural circadian rhythms within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and between the SCN and peripheral tissues. Compounding this, modern life can involve repeated disruptive light conditions. To model chronic disruption to the circadian system, we exposed male mice to more than a month of a 20-hr light cycle (LD10:10), which mice typically cannot entrain to. Control animals were housed under LD12:12. We measured locomotor activity and body temperature rhythms in vivo, and rhythms of PER2::LUC bioluminescence in SCN and peripheral tissues ex vivo. Unexpectedly, we discovered strong effects of the time of dissection on circadian phase of PER2::LUC bioluminescent rhythms, which varied across tissues. White adipose tissue was strongly reset by dissection, while thymus phase appeared independent of dissection timing. Prior light exposure impacted the SCN, resulting in strong resetting of SCN phase by dissection for mice housed under LD10:10, and weak phase shifts by time of dissection in SCN from control LD12:12 mice. These findings suggest that exposure to circadian disruption may desynchronize SCN neurons, increasing network sensitivity to perturbations. We propose that tissues with a weakened circadian network, such as the SCN under disruptive light conditions, or with little to no coupling, for example, some peripheral tissues, will show increased resetting effects. In particular, exposure to light at inconsistent circadian times on a recurring weekly basis disrupts circadian rhythms and alters sensitivity of the SCN neural pacemaker to dissection time.},

  abstract = {Accelerometers are a valuable tool for studying animal behaviour and physiology where direct observation is unfeasible. However, giving biological meaning to multivariate acceleration data is challenging. Here, we describe a method that reliably classifies a large number of behaviours using tri-axial accelerometer data collected at the low sampling frequency of 1 Hz, using the dingo (Canis dingo) as an example. We used out-of-sample validation to compare the predictive performance of four commonly used classification models (random forest, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes). We tested the importance of predictor variable selection and moving window size for the classification of each behaviour and overall model performance. Random forests produced the highest out-of-sample classification accuracy, with our best-performing model predicting 14 behaviours with a mean accuracy of 87\%. We also investigated the relationship between overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and the activity level of each behaviour, given the increasing use of ODBA in ecophysiology as a proxy for energy expenditure. ODBA values for our four ‘high activity’ behaviours were significantly greater than all other behaviours, with an overall positive trend between ODBA and intensity of movement. We show that a random forest model of relatively low complexity can mitigate some major challenges associated with establishing meaningful ecological conclusions from acceleration data. Our approach has broad applicability to free-ranging terrestrial quadrupeds of comparable size. Our use of a low sampling frequency shows potential for deploying accelerometers over extended time periods, enabling the capture of invaluable behavioural and physiological data across different ontogenies.},

As it is becoming apparent that activity plays an integral role in a number of physiological processes including arousal, attention, cardiovascular health and body weight regulation, there is an increased interest in quantifying activity. Nonhuman primates are particularly useful experimental models for such studies in that they exhibit a repertoire of activity more similar to humans than the activity of animals such as rodents and domestic animals. Recent studies measuring activity in nonhuman primates have used omnidirectional accelerometers, often worn on collars; however, the exact behaviors and movements detected by monkeys wearing these devices have not yet been characterized. To test the hypothesis that collar-worn accelerometers primarily detect movements that involve movement of the whole body, 16 adult female rhesus monkeys, housed individually in stainless steel cages, wore loose-fitting collars with an attached small metal box housing an activity monitor (Actical omnidirectional accelerometer; MiniMitter Inc., Bend, OR) and behavior was videotaped. Videotaped behaviors were analyzed by frame-by-frame analysis. There was a significant correlation between total (all) movement revealed by videotape analysis and activity counts detected by the accelerometers (r(s)=0.612, P=0.012), primarily reflecting a strong correlation between whole body movement and activity counts (r(s)=0.647, P=0.007). In contrast, arm movement (r(s)=-0.221, P=0.412) and head/neck movement (r(s)=0.193, P=0.474) were not correlated with activity counts. These findings support the hypothesis that activity monitor placement on a collar allows for effective quantification of whole body movement in monkeys, and indicate that behaviors such as chewing and arm movement do not significantly influence activity recorded by collar-mounted accelerometers.},

An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one's own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Social interactions occur between multiple individuals, but what is the detailed relationship between the neural dynamics across their brains? To address this question across timescales and levels of neural activity, we used wireless electrophysiology to simultaneously record from pairs of bats engaged in a wide range of natural social interactions. We found that neural activity was remarkably correlated between their brains over timescales from seconds to hours. The correlation depended on a shared social environment and was most prominent in high frequency local field potentials ({$>$}30 Hz), followed by local spiking activity. Furthermore, the degree of neural correlation covaried with the extent of social interactions, and an increase in correlation preceded their initiation. These results show that inter-brain correlation is an inherent feature of natural social interactions, reveal the domain of neural activity where it is most prominent, and provide a foundation for studying its functional role in social behaviors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To draw informative conclusions from null-effects, researchers need to move beyond the incorrect interpretation of a non-significant result in a null-hypothesis significance test as evidence of the absence of an effect. We explain how to statistically evaluate null-results using equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and Bayes factors. A worked example demonstrates how to apply these statistical tools and interpret the results. Finally, we explain how no statistical approach can actually prove that the null-hypothesis is true, and briefly discuss the philosophical differences between statistical approaches to examine null-effects. The increasing availability of easy-to-use software and online tools to perform equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and calculate Bayes factors make it timely and feasible to complement or move beyond traditional null-hypothesis tests, and allow researchers to draw more informative conclusions about null-effects.},

  abstract = {Ambient temperature (Ta) warming toward the high end of the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) preferentially increases~rapid eye movement (REM) sleep over non-REM (NREM) sleep across species. The control and function of this temperature-induced REM sleep~expression have remained unknown. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons play an important role in REM sleep control. We hypothesize that the MCH system may modulate REM sleep as a function of Ta. Here, we show that wild-type (WT) mice dynamically increased REM sleep durations specifically during warm Ta pulsing within the TNZ, compared to both the TNZ cool and baseline constant Ta conditions, without significantly affecting either wake or NREM sleep durations. However, genetically engineered MCH receptor-1 knockout (MCHR1-KO) mice showed no significant changes in REM sleep as a function of Ta, even with increased sleep pressure following a 4-h sleep deprivation. Using MCH-cre mice transduced with channelrhodopsin, we then optogenetically activated MCH neurons time locked with Ta warming, showing an increase in REM sleep expression beyond what Ta warming in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) control mice achieved. Finally, in mice transduced with archaerhodopsin-T, semi-chronic optogenetic MCH neuronal silencing during Ta warming completely blocked the increase in REM sleep seen in YFP controls. These data demonstrate a previously unknown role for the MCH system in the dynamic output expression of REM sleep during Ta manipulation. These findings are consistent with the energy allocation hypothesis of sleep function, suggesting that endotherms have evolved neural circuits to opportunistically express REM sleep when the need for thermoregulatory defense is minimized.},

  abstract = {The circadian disruption seen in patients of Huntington's disease (HD) is recapitulated in the R6/2 mouse model. As the disease progresses, the activity of R6/2 mice increases dramatically during the rest (light) period and decreases during the active (dark) period, eventually leading to a complete disintegration of rest-activity rhythms by the age of \textasciitilde{}16 weeks. The suprachiasmatic nucleus controls circadian rhythms by entraining the rest-activity rhythms to the environmental light-dark cycle. Since R6/2 mice can shift their rest-activity rhythms in response to a jet-lag paradigm and also respond positively to bright light therapy (1000 lx), we investigated whether or not a prolonged day length exposure could reduce their daytime activity and improve their behavioural circadian rhythms. We found that a long-day photoperiod (16~h light/8~h dark cycle; 100 lx) significantly improved the survival of R6/2 female mice by 2.4 weeks, compared to mice kept under standard conditions (12~h light/12~h dark cycle). Furthermore, a long-day photoperiod improved the nocturnality of R6/2 female mice. Mice kept under long-day photoperiod also maintained acrophase in activity rhythms (a parameter of rhythmicity strength) in phase with that of WT mice, even if they were symptomatic. By contrast, a short-day photoperiod (8~h light/16~h dark cycle) was deleterious to R6/2 female mice and further reduced the survival by \textasciitilde{}1 week. Together, our results support the idea that light therapy may be beneficial for improving circadian dysfunction in HD patients.},

  abstract = {A decrease in adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to age-related cognitive impairment. However, the mechanisms involved in this age-related reduction remain elusive. Glucocorticoid hormones (GC) are important regulators of neural stem/precursor cells (NSPC) proliferation. GC are released from the adrenal glands in ultradian secretory pulses that generate characteristic circadian oscillations. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that GC oscillations prevent NSPC activation and preserve a quiescent NSPC pool in the aging hippocampus. We found that hippocampal NSPC populations lacking expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) decayed exponentially with age, while GR-positive populations decayed linearly and predominated in the hippocampus from middle age onwards. Importantly, GC oscillations controlled NSPC activation and GR knockdown reactivated NSPC proliferation in aged mice. When modeled in primary hippocampal NSPC cultures, GC oscillations control cell cycle progression and induce specific genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. GC oscillations induced lasting changes in the methylation state of a group of gene promoters associated with cell cycle regulation and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Finally, in a mouse model of accelerated aging, we show that disruption of GC oscillations induces lasting changes in dendritic complexity, spine numbers and morphology of newborn granule neurons. Together, these results indicate that GC oscillations preserve a population of GR-expressing NSPC during aging, preventing their activation possibly by epigenetic programming through methylation of specific gene promoters. Our observations suggest a novel mechanism mediated by GC that controls NSPC proliferation and preserves a dormant NSPC pool, possibly contributing to a neuroplasticity reserve in the aging brain.},

Using data from 2 prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (1988-2012; n = 78,516) and Nurses' Health Study II (1989-2013; n = 114,559), we examined associations between rotating night-shift work and breast cancer risk. In the 2 cohorts, there were a total of 9,541 incident invasive breast malignancies and 24 years of follow-up. In the Nurses' Health Study, women with 30 years or more of shift work did not have a higher risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.95, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.77, 1.17; P for trend = 0.63) compared with those who never did shift work, although follow-up occurred primarily after retirement from shift work. Among participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, who were younger than participants in the other cohort, the risk of breast cancer was significantly higher in women with 20 years or more of shift work at baseline, reflecting young-adult exposure (HR = 2.15, 95\% CI: 1.23, 3.73; P for trend = 0.23), and was marginally significantly higher for women with 20 years or more of cumulative shift work when we used updated exposure information (HR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.97; P for trend = 0.74). In conclusion, long-term rotating night-shift work was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer, particularly among women who performed shift work during young adulthood. Further studies should explore the role of shift work timing on breast cancer risk.},

Methods This analysis included 1626 incident CRC cases and 3378 randomly selected population controls of both sexes, enrolled in 11 regions of Spain. Sociodemographic and lifestyle information was assessed in face-to-face interviews. Shift work was assessed in detail throughout lifetime occupational history. We estimated the risk of colon and rectal cancer associated with rotating and permanent shift work (ever, cumulative duration, age of first exposure) using unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. Results Having ever performed rotating shift work (morning, evening and/or night) was associated with an increased risk for CRC [odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.04-1.43], as compared to day workers. Having ever worked permanent night shifts (≥3 nights/month) was not associated with CRC risk (OR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.62-1.00). OR increased with increasing lifetime cumulative duration of rotating shift work (P-value for trend 0.005) and were highest among subjects in the top quartiles of exposure (3 rdquartile, 20-34 years, OR 1.38, 95\%CI 1.06-1.81; 4 thquartile, ≥35 years, OR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.02-1.79).

  abstract = {Exposure to Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) results in a disruption of the circadian system, which is deleterious to health. In industrialized countries, 75\% of the total workforce is estimated to have been involved in shift work and night work. Epidemiologic studies, mainly of nurses, have revealed an association between sustained night work and a 50–100\% higher incidence of breast cancer. The potential and multifactorial mechanisms of the effects include the suppression of melatonin secretion by ALAN, sleep deprivation, and circadian disruption. Shift and/or night work generally decreases the time spent sleeping, and it disrupts the circadian time structure. In the long run, this desynchronization is detrimental to health, as underscored by a large number of epidemiological studies that have uncovered elevated rates of several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular risks, obesity, mood disorders and age-related macular degeneration. It amounts to a public health issue in the light of the very substantial number of individuals involved. The IARC has classified shift work in group 2A of “probable carcinogens to humans” since “they involve a circadian disorganization”. Countermeasures to the effects of ALAN, such as melatonin, bright light, or psychotropic drugs, have been proposed as a means to combat circadian clock disruption and improve adaptation to shift and night work. We review the evidence for the ALAN impacts on health. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of an in-depth mechanistic understanding to combat the detrimental properties of exposure to ALAN and develop strategies of prevention.},

Data extraction Study quality was assessed with the Downs and Black scale for observational studies. The three primary outcomes were myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and any coronary event. Heterogeneity was measured with the I2 statistic and computed random effects models.
Results 34 studies in 2 011 935 people were identified. Shift work was associated with myocardial infarction (risk ratio 1.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.31; I2=0) and ischaemic stroke (1.05, 1.01 to 1.09; I2=0). Coronary events were also increased (risk ratio 1.24, 1.10 to 1.39), albeit with significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=85\%). Pooled risk ratios were significant for both unadjusted analyses and analyses adjusted for risk factors. All shift work schedules with the exception of evening shifts were associated with a statistically higher risk of coronary events. Shift work was not associated with increased rates of mortality (whether vascular cause specific or overall). Presence or absence of adjustment for smoking and socioeconomic status was not a source of heterogeneity in the primary studies. 6598 myocardial infarctions, 17 359 coronary events, and 1854 ischaemic strokes occurred. On the basis of the Canadian prevalence of shift work of 32.8\%, the population attributable risks related to shift work were 7.0\% for myocardial infarction, 7.3\% for all coronary events, and 1.6\% for ischaemic stroke.
Conclusions Shift work is associated with vascular events, which may have implications for public policy and occupational medicine.},

  abstract = {Aims: Why are some healthy male shift workers (SWers) overweight [body mass index (BMI) {$>$}25 and {$<$}30] if not obese (BMI {$>$}30)? Seven risk factors potentially causing overweight and obesity were evaluated, namely (1) age, (2) physical/sports activity, (3) length of exposure to shift work (SW), (4) speed of shift rotation, (5) tolerance to SW, (6) internal desynchronization of circadian rhythms and (8) night eating (nocturnal nibbling). “New” as well as “old” data, acquired from longitudinal and individual time series of 5–56 days recording span, were reanalyzed. The data were analyzed from a set of field studies of 67 SWers and 53 non-shift workers (non-SWers). To estimate the respective weight of these factors, a multiple regression analysis (MRA) was used among other statistical tools. A similar age-related increase in BMI was validated (with p {$<$} 0.001) in both SWers and non-SWers. However, in SWers, desynchronization of rhythms increases the effect of age on BMI. Length of exposure to SW, tolerance to SW and speed of rotation do not seem to play a role as risk factors. Major effects are likely to relate to a sedentary lifestyle (lack of regular physical or sport activities) (MRA with p {$<$} 0.01), as well as, presumably, to a nocturnal nibbling of carbohydrates, which mimics the night eating syndrome.},

  abstract = {Objectives Shift work, like chronic jet lag, is known to disrupt workers’ normal circadian rhythms and social life, and to be associated with increased health problems (eg, ulcers, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, breast cancer, reproductive difficulties) and with acute effects on safety and productivity. However, very little is known about the long-term consequences of shift work on cognitive abilities. The aim of this study was to assess the chronicity and reversibility of the effects of shift work on cognition.
Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3232 employed and retired workers (participation rate: 76\%) who were 32, 42, 52 and 62 years old at the time of the first measurement (t1, 1996), and who were seen again 5 (t2) and 10 (t3) years later. 1484 of them had shift work experience at baseline (current or past) and 1635 had not. The main outcome measures were tests of speed and memory, assessed at all three measurement times.
Results Shift work was associated with impaired cognition. The association was stronger for exposure durations exceeding 10 years (dose effect; cognitive loss equivalent to 6.5 years of age-related decline in the current cohort). The recovery of cognitive functioning after having left shift work took at least 5 years (reversibility).
Conclusions Shift work chronically impairs cognition, with potentially important safety consequences not only for the individuals concerned, but also for society.},

Cell-autonomous circadian clocks interact with daily light-dark and feeding-fasting cycles to generate approximately 24-hour oscillations in the function of thousands of genes. Circadian expression of secreted molecules and signaling components transmits timing information between cells and tissues. Such intra- and intercellular daily rhythms optimize physiology both by managing energy use and by temporally segregating incompatible processes. Experimental animal models and epidemiological data indicate that chronic circadian rhythm disruption increases the risk of metabolic diseases. Conversely, time-restricted feeding, which imposes daily cycles of feeding and fasting without caloric reduction, sustains robust diurnal rhythms and can alleviate metabolic diseases. These findings highlight an integrative role of circadian rhythms in physiology and offer a new perspective for treating chronic diseases in which metabolic disruption is a hallmark.},

Circadian rhythms, generated by a circadian clock, control temporal programs of cellular physiology to facilitate adaptation to daily environmental changes. Circadian rhythms are nearly ubiquitous and are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here we introduce the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We review the current understanding of the cyanobacterial clock, emphasizing recent work that has generated a more comprehensive understanding of how the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized with the external environment and how information from the oscillator is transmitted to generate rhythms of biological activity. These results have changed how we think about the clock, shifting away from a linear model to one in which the clock is viewed as an interactive network of multifunctional components that are integrated into the context of the cell in order to pace and reset the oscillator. We conclude with a discussion of how this basic timekeeping mechanism differs in other cyanobacterial species and how information gleaned from work in cyanobacteria can be translated to understanding rhythmic phenomena in other prokaryotic systems.},

The advantage conferred on organisms that anticipate such environmental cycles has driven the evolution of endogenous circadian rhythms that tune internal physiology to external conditions. The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation–reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms. Furthermore, we explore the interconnectivity between these metabolic cycles and transcription–translation feedback loops of the clockwork in each system. Our results suggest an intimate co-evolution of cellular timekeeping with redox homeostatic mechanisms after the Great Oxidation Event ∼2.5 billion years ago.},

  shorttitle = {Social Influences on Mammalian Circadian Rhythms},
  abstract = {While light is considered the dominant stimulus for entraining (synchronizing) mammalian circadian rhythms to local environmental time, social stimuli are also widely cited as 'zeitgebers' (time-cues). This review critically assesses the evidence for social influences on mammalian circadian rhythms, and possible mechanisms of action. Social stimuli may affect circadian behavioural programmes by regulating the phase and period of circadian clocks (i.e. a zeitgeber action, either direct or by conditioning to photic zeitgebers), by influencing daily patterns of light exposure or modulating light input to the clock, or by associative learning processes that utilize circadian time as a discriminative or conditioned stimulus. There is good evidence that social stimuli can act as zeitgebers. In several species maternal signals are the primary zeitgeber in utero and prior to weaning. Adults of some species can also be phase shifted or entrained by single or periodic social interactions, but these effects are often weak, and appear to be mediated by social stimulation of arousal. There is no strong evidence yet for sensory-specific nonphotic inputs to the clock. The circadian phase-dependence of clock resetting to social stimuli or arousal (the 'nonphotic' phase response curve, PRC), where known, is distinct from that to light and similar in diurnal and nocturnal animals. There is some evidence that induction of arousal can modulate light input to the clock, but no studies yet of whether social stimuli can shift the clock by conditioning to photic cues, or be incorporated into the circadian programme by associative learning. In humans, social zeitgebers appear weak by comparison with light. In temporal isolation or under weak light-dark cycles, humans may ignore social cues and free-run independently, although cases of mutual synchrony among two or more group-housed individuals have been reported. Social cues may affect circadian timing by controlling sleep-wake states, but the phase of entrainment observed to fixed sleep-wake schedules in dim light is consistent with photic mediation (scheduled variations in behavioural state necessarily create daily light-dark cycles unless subjects are housed in constant dark or have no eyes). By contrast, discrete exercise sessions can induce phase shifts consistent with the nonphotic PRC observed in animal studies. The best evidence for social entrainment in humans is from a few totally blind subjects who synchronize to the 24 h day, or to near-24 h sleep-wake schedules under laboratory conditions. However, the critical entraining stimuli have not yet been identified, and there are no reported cases yet of social entrainment in bilaterally enucleated blind subjects. The role of social zeitgebers in mammalian behavioural ecology, their mechanisms of action, and their utility for manipulating circadian rhythms in humans, remains to be more fully elaborated.},

Also, we present results on four topics of food anticipation: (1) possible input signals to FEO, (2) FEO substrate, (3) the importance of canonical clock genes for FAA, and (4) potential practical applications of scheduled feeding. This mini review is intended to introduce the subject of food entrainment to those unfamiliar with it but also present them with relevant new findings on the issue.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin photoreception plays a vital role in irradiance detection for non-image forming responses to light. However, little is known about the involvement of melanopsin in emotional processing of luminance. When confronted with a gradient in light, organisms exhibit spatial movements relative to this stimulus. In rodents, behavioural light aversion (BLA) is a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon during which animals attribute salience to light and remove themselves from it. Here, using genetically modified mice and an open field behavioural paradigm, we investigate the role of melanopsin in BLA. While wildtype (WT), melanopsin knockout (Opn4(-/-)) and rd/rd cl (melanopsin only (MO)) mice all exhibit BLA, our novel methodology reveals that isolated melanopsin photoreception produces a slow, potentiating response to light. In order to control for the involvement of pupillary constriction in BLA we eliminated this variable with topical atropine application. This manipulation enhanced BLA in WT and MO mice, but most remarkably, revealed light aversion in triple knockout (TKO) mice, lacking three elements deemed essential for conventional photoreception (Opn4(-/-) Gnat1(-/-) Cnga3(-/-)). Using a number of complementary strategies, we determined this response to be generated at the level of the retina. Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of how melanopsin signalling may modulate aversive responses to light in mice and humans. In addition, we also reveal a clear potential for light perception in TKO mice.},

The PAR-domain basic leucine zipper (PAR bZip) transcription factors DBP, TEF, and HLF accumulate in a highly circadian manner in several peripheral tissues, including liver and kidney. Mice devoid of all three of these proteins are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but are epilepsy prone, age at an accelerated rate, and die prematurely. In the hope of identifying PAR bZip target genes whose altered expression might contribute to the high morbidity and mortality of PAR bZip triple knockout mice, we compared the liver and kidney transcriptomes of these animals to those of wild-type or heterozygous mutant mice. These experiments revealed that PAR bZip proteins control the expression of many enzymes and regulators involved in detoxification and drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Indeed, PAR bZip triple knockout mice are hypersensitive to xenobiotic compounds, and the deficiency in detoxification may contribute to their early aging.},

  abstract = {Mammals have circadian clocks in peripheral tissues, but there is no direct evidence of their physiological importance. Unlike the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock that is set by light and drives rest-activity and fasting-feeding cycles, peripheral clocks are set by daily feeding, suggesting that at least some contribute metabolic regulation. The liver plays a well known role in glucose homeostasis, and we report here that mice with a liver-specific deletion of Bmal1, an essential clock component, exhibited hypoglycemia restricted to the fasting phase of the daily feeding cycle, exaggerated glucose clearance, and loss of rhythmic expression of hepatic glucose regulatory genes. We conclude that the liver clock is important for buffering circulating glucose in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the liver clock contributes to homeostasis by driving a daily rhythm of hepatic glucose export that counterbalances the daily cycle of glucose ingestion resulting from the fasting-feeding cycle.},

This review briefly summarises historical research on the influences of locomotor activity and its correlates on circadian function and then discusses recent advances in this area. Locomotor exercise can acutely alter circadian phase, both of overt behavioural rhythms and in peripheral tissues, and can stably entrain rhythms in behaviour driven by the hypothalamic master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Locomotor activity potently and acutely suppresses both electrical activity and clock gene expression in the master circadian pacemaker of the hypothalamus, though mechanistically how this is achieved is still unclear, as are the effects of locomotor activity in diurnal species, including humans.},

  abstract = {The mammalian circadian system is orchestrated by a master pacemaker in the brain, but many peripheral tissues also contain independent or quasi-independent circadian oscillators. The adaptive significance of clocks in these structures must lie, in large part, in the phase relationships between the constituent oscillators and their micro- and macroenvironments. To examine the relationship between postnatal development, which is dependent on endogenous programs and maternal/environmental influences, and the phase of circadian oscillators, the authors assessed the circadian phase of pineal, liver, lung, adrenal, and thyroid tissues cultured from Period 1-luciferase (Per1-luc ) rat pups of various postnatal ages. The liver, thyroid, and pineal were rhythmic at birth, but the phases of their Per1-luc expression rhythms shifted remarkably during development. To determine if the timing of the phase shift in each tissue could be the result of changing environmental conditions, the behavior of pups and their mothers was monitored. The circadian phase of the liver shifted from the day to night around postnatal day (P) 22 as the pups nursed less during the light and instead ate solid food during the dark. Furthermore, the phase of Per1-luc expression in liver cultures from nursing neonates could be shifted experimentally from the day to the night by allowing pups access to the dam only during the dark. Peak Per1-luc expression also shifted from midday to early night in thyroid cultures at about P20, concurrent with the shift in eating times. The phase of Per1-luc expression in the pineal gland shifted from day to night coincident with its sympathetic innervation at around P5. Per1-luc expression was rhythmic in adrenal cultures and peaked around the time of lights-off throughout development; however, the amplitude of the rhythm increased at P25. Lung cultures were completely arrhythmic until P12 when the pups began to leave the nest. Taken together, the data suggest that the molecular machinery that generates circadian oscillations matures at different rates in different tissues and that the phase of at least some peripheral organs is malleable and may shift as the organ's function changes during development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The circadian rhythm of about 24 hours is a fundamental physiological function observed in almost all organisms from prokaryotes to humans. Identification of clock genes has allowed us to study the molecular bases for circadian behaviors and temporal physiological processes such as hormonal secretion, and has prompted the idea that molecular clocks reside not only in a central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of hypothalamus in mammals, but also in peripheral tissues, even in immortalized cells. Furthermore, previous molecular dissection revealed that the mechanism of circadian oscillation at a molecular level is based on transcriptional regulation of clock and clock-controlled genes.
RESULTS: We systematically analyzed the mRNA expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in mouse peripheral tissues. Eight genes (mBmal1, mNpas2, mRev-erbalpha, mDbp, mRev-erbbeta, mPer3, mPer1 and mPer2; given in the temporal order of the rhythm peak) showed robust circadian expressions of mRNAs in all tissues except testis, suggesting that these genes are core molecules of the molecular biological clock. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that these genes have one or a combination of 3 transcriptional elements (RORE, DBPE, and E-box), which are conserved among human, mouse, and rat genome sequences, and indicated that these 3 elements may be responsible for the biological timing of expression of canonical clock genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation of oscillatory profiles of canonical clock genes is not only useful for physiological and pathological examination of the circadian clock in various organs but also important for systematic understanding of transcriptional regulation on a genome-wide basis. Our finding of the oscillatory expression of canonical clock genes with a temporal order provides us an interesting hypothesis, that cyclic timing of all clock and clock-controlled genes may be dependent on several transcriptional elements including 3 known elements, E-box, RORE, and DBPE.},

  abstract = {In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology, and in particular cellular metabolism, are coordinated by the circadian timing system. Molecular clocks are thought to rely on negative feedback loops in clock gene expression that engender oscillations in the accumulation of transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as the orphan receptor REV-ERBalpha. Circadian transcription factors then drive daily rhythms in the expression of clock-controlled output genes, for example genes encoding enzymes and regulators of cellular metabolism. To gain insight into clock output functions of REV-ERBalpha, we carried out genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice, or REV-ERBalpha overexpressing mice. On the basis of these genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we concluded that REV-ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry.},

  abstract = {In the liver, clock genes are proposed to drive metabolic rhythms. These gene rhythms are driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mainly by food intake and via autonomic and hormonal pathways. Forced activity during the normal rest phase, induces also food intake, thus neglecting the signals of the SCN, leading to conflicting time signals to target tissues of the SCN. The present study explored in a rodent model of night-work the influence of food during the normal sleep period on the synchrony of gene expression between clock genes and metabolic genes in the liver. Male Wistar rats were exposed to forced activity for 8 h either during the rest phase (day) or during the active phase (night) by using a slow rotating wheel. In this shift work model food intake shifts spontaneously to the forced activity period, therefore the influence of food alone without induced activity was tested in other groups of animals that were fed ad libitum, or fed during their rest or active phase. Rats forced to be active and/or eating during their rest phase, inverted their daily peak of Per1, Bmal1 and Clock and lost the rhythm of Per2 in the liver, moreover NAMPT and metabolic genes such as Pparα lost their rhythm and thus their synchrony with clock genes. We conclude that shift work or food intake in the rest phase leads to desynchronization within the liver, characterized by misaligned temporal patterns of clock genes and metabolic genes. This may be the cause of the development of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in individuals engaged in shift work.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: It has been well established in mammals that circadian behavior as well as the molecular clockwork can be synchronized to the light-dark cycle via the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN). In addition to light, it has been demonstrated that nonphotic time cues, such as restricting the time of food availability, can alter circadian behavior and clock gene expression in selected peripheral tissues such as the liver. Studies have also suggested that scheduled physical activity (exercise) can alter circadian rhythms in behavior and clock gene expression; however, currently, the effects of exercise alone are largely unknown and have not been explored in skeletal muscle.
METHODS: Period2::Luciferase (Per2::Luc) mice were maintained under 12 h of light followed by 12 h of darkness then exposed to 2 h of voluntary or involuntary exercise during the light phase for 4 wk. Control mice were left in home cages or moved to the exercise environment (sham). A second group of mice had restricted access to food (4 h · d(-1) for 2 wk) to compare the effects of two nonphotic cues on PER2::LUC bioluminescence. Skeletal muscle, lung, and SCN tissue explants were cultured for 5-6 d to study molecular rhythms.
RESULTS: In the exercised mice, the phase of peak PER2::LUC bioluminescence was shifted in the skeletal muscle and lung explants but not in the SCN suggesting a specific synchronizing effect of exercise on the molecular clockwork in peripheral tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the molecular circadian clock in peripheral tissues can respond to the time of exercise suggesting that physical activity contributes important timing information for synchronization of circadian clocks throughout the body.},

  abstract = {Exercise during the inactive period can entrain locomotor activity and peripheral circadian clock rhythm in mice; however, mechanisms underlying this entrainment are yet to be elucidated. Here, we showed that the bioluminescence rhythm of peripheral clocks in PER2::LUC mice was strongly entrained by forced treadmill and forced wheel-running exercise rather than by voluntary wheel-running exercise at middle time during the inactivity period. Exercise-induced entrainment was accompanied by increased levels of serum corticosterone and norepinephrine in peripheral tissues, similar to the physical stress-induced response. Adrenalectomy with norepinephrine receptor blockers completely blocked the treadmill exercise-induced entrainment. The entrainment of the peripheral clock by exercise is independent of the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock, the main oscillator in mammals. The present results suggest that the response of forced exercise, but not voluntary exercise, may be similar to that of stress, and possesses the entrainment ability of peripheral clocks through the activation of the adrenal gland and the sympathetic nervous system.},

  abstract = {Key points • The circadian system drives rhythms of behaviour, physiology and gene expression in alignment to a light–dark cycle, and misalignment of the internal clock with the external environment can lead to disease. • We sought to determine whether scheduled exercise could alter rhythmic properties in mice while subjected to the strong entrainment effects of light and whether we could improve diurnal deficits observed in the vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP)-deficient mouse. • Scheduled exercise altered daily rhythms of activity, physiology and gene expression in wild-type and VIP-deficient mice. • Scheduled exercise during the late night improved many of the rhythmic deficits observed in VIP-deficient mice, including changes in gene expression within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of circadian rhythm generation. • The results raise the possibility that scheduled exercise could be a tool to drive and improve daily rhythms in humans to mitigate the negative consequences of circadian misalignment. Abstract The circadian system co-ordinates the temporal patterning of behaviour and many underlying biological processes. In some cases, the regulated outputs of the circadian system, such as activity, may be able to feed back to alter core clock processes. In our studies, we used four wheel-access conditions (no access; free access; early night; and late night) to manipulate the duration and timing of activity while under the influence of a light–dark cycle. In wild-type mice, scheduled wheel access was able to increase ambulatory activity, inducing a level of exercise driven at various phases of the light–dark cycle. Scheduled exercise also manipulated the magnitude and phasing of the circadian-regulated outputs of heart rate and body temperature. At a molecular level, the phasing and amplitude of PER2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) expression rhythms in the SCN and peripheral tissues of Per2::Luc knockin mice were altered by scheduled exercise. We then tested whether scheduled wheel access could improve deficits observed in vasointestinal polypeptide-deficient mice under the influence of a light–dark cycle. We found that scheduled wheel access during the late night improved many of the behavioural, physiological and molecular deficits previously described in vasointestinal polypeptide-deficient mice. Our results raise the possibility that scheduled exercise could be used as a tool to modulate daily rhythms and, when applied, may counteract some of the negative impacts of ageing and disease on the circadian system.},

  abstract = {Domestication has shaped the physiology and the behaviour of animals to better adapt to human environments. Therefore, human facial expressions may be highly informative for animals domesticated for working closely with people, such as dogs and horses. However, it is not known whether other animals, and particularly those domesticated primarily for production, such as goats, are capable of perceiving human emotional cues. In this study, we investigated whether goats can distinguish human facial expressions when simultaneously shown two images of an unfamiliar human with different emotional valences (positive/happy or negative/angry). Both images were vertically attached to a wall on one side of a test arena, 1.3 m apart, and goats were released from the opposite side of the arena (distance of 4.0 m) and were free to explore and interact with the stimuli during the trials. Each of four test trials lasted 30 s. Overall, we found that goats preferred to interact first with happy faces, meaning that they are sensitive to human facial emotional cues. Goats interacted first, more often and for longer duration with positive faces when they were positioned on the right side. However, no preference was found when the positive faces were placed on the left side. We show that animals domesticated for production can discriminate human facial expressions with different emotional valences and prefer to interact with positive ones. Therefore, the impact of domestication on animal cognitive abilities may be more far-reaching than previously assumed.},

Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a growing body of evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1–5]. Here we show that sleep is also present in Cnidaria [6–8], an earlier-branching metazoan lineage. Cnidaria and Ctenophora are the first metazoan phyla to evolve tissue-level organization and differentiated cell types, such as neurons and muscle [9–15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into a non-centralized radially symmetric nerve net [11, 13, 15–17] that nevertheless shares fundamental properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic transmission, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15–20]. It was reported that cnidarian soft corals [21] and box jellyfish [22, 23] exhibit periods of quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting us to ask whether sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish \emph{Cassiopea spp.} displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform long-term behavioral tracking. Monitoring of \emph{Cassiopea} pulsing activity for consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral quiescence at night that is rapidly reversible, as well as a delayed response to stimulation in the quiescent state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, \emph{Cassiopea} exhibited decreased activity and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent day, consistent with homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together, these results indicate that \emph{Cassiopea} has a sleep-like state, supporting the hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to the emergence of a centralized nervous system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This technique was first described in 1937 and later adapted 3 times: first, in 1957, after the detection of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when electrooculography (EOG) was added; second, in 1968, when sleep staging was standardized and electromyography (EMG) was added; and third, in 2007, to integrate accumulated knowledge from sleep science, adding arousals and respiratory, cardiac, and movement events. In spite of the dramatic changes that have taken place in recording and storing techniques, sleep staging has undergone surprisingly few changes. The argument of the present comment is that sleep staging was appropriate as long as sleep biosignals were recorded in the analog mode as curves on paper, whereas this staging may be insufficient for digitally recorded and stored sleep data. Limitations of sleep staging are critically discussed and alternative strategies of sleep analysis are emphasized.},

  abstract = {To investigate the relationship between circadian rhythms of body temperature and sleep-wake stages, four squirrel monkeys were prepared for unrestrained monitoring of temperature, locomotor activity, electroencephalogram, electroculogram, and electromyogram. Continuous records for each animal were made for several 12-h light-dark (LD) cycles and then after a few days in constant illumination (LL). All animals maintained consolidated sleep-wake cycles and had a longer circadian period (mean 24.7 h) in LL than in LD (mean 24.1 h). The increased period reflected greater time per circadian cycle spent awake in LL (mean 14.0 h) than in LD (mean 12.8 h). Total night NREM sleep was less in LL (mean 6.5 h) than in LD (mean 8.2 h). Sleep onset occurred at later phases in LL (187 +/- 6 degrees) than in LD (170 +/- 2 degrees). Because the circadian phase measure of NREM sleep was unchanged between LD and LL conditions, the difference in sleep onsets reflected balanced changes in NREM circadian waveforms. Wake-up phases were the same in both conditions (mean 342 degrees). In summary, during free run squirrel monkeys maintain a stable consolidated circadian sleep-wake cycle with a period greater than 24 h, but they exhibit only minimal internal phase restructuring.},

Sleep is a complex physiologic process that is influenced by many internal and environmental factors, and problems with sleep are often related to specific personal circumstances or are based on subjective reports from the affected person. Although human subjects are used widely in the study of sleep and sleep disorders, the study of animals has been invaluable in developing our understanding about the physiology of sleep and the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders. Historically, the use of animals for the study of sleep disorders has arguably been most fruitful for the condition of narcolepsy, in which studies of dogs and mice revealed previously unsuspected mechanisms for this condition. The current overview considers animal models that have been used to study 4 of the most common human sleep disorders—insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea—and summarizes considerations relevant to the use of animals for the study of sleep and sleep disorders. Animal-based research has been vital to the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie sleep, its regulation, and its disorders and undoubtedly will remain crucial for discovering and validating sleep mechanisms and testing interventions for sleep disorders.},

  abstract = {The 1968 Rechtschaffen and Kales (R \& K) sleep scoring manual was published 15 years after REM sleep was discovered. Advances in the ensuing 28 years warranted a re-look at visual scoring of sleep stages. This paper describes the work of the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R \& K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of EEG, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin EMG were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of REM sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of REM sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules. Future advances in technology may require modification of these rules with time.},

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Sleep Medicine and Research concluded that although clinical activities and scientific opportunities in the field are expanding, awareness among the general public and health care professionals is low, given the magnitude of the burden. The available human resources and capacity are insufficient to further develop the science and to diagnose and treat individuals with sleep disorders. Therefore, the current situation necessitates a larger and more interdisciplinary workforce. Traditional scientific and medical disciplines need to be attracted into the somnology and sleep medicine field. Renewed and revitalized commitments to the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), academic health centers, private foundations, and professional societies are essential to ensure appropriate public and professional awareness, education and training, basic and clinical research, and patient care.

In this review, we will examine the specific neuronal pathways, transmitters, and receptors composing the ascending arousal system that flow from the brainstem through the thalamus, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex. We will also discuss the mutually inhibitory interaction between the core neuronal components of this arousal system and the sleep-active neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, which serves as a brainstem-switch, regulating the stability of the sleep-wake states. In addition, we will review the role of homeostatic and circadian processes in the sleep-wake cycle, including the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus on coordination of sleep-wake systems. Finally, we will summarize how the above processes are reflected in disorders of sleep and wakefulness, including insomnia, narcolepsy, disorders associated with fragmented sleep, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and primary neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.},

  abstract = {The origins of the cholinergic and other afferents of several thalamic nuclei were investigated in the rat by using the retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated-horseradish peroxidase in combination with the immunohistochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity. Small injections placed into the reticular, ventral, laterodorsal, lateroposterior, posterior, mediodorsal, geniculate, and intralaminar nuclei resulted in several distinct patterns of retrograde labelling. As expected, the appropriate specific sensory and motor-related subcortical structures were retrogradely labelled after injections into the principal thalamic nuclei. In addition, other basal forebrain and brainstem structures were also labelled, with their distribution dependent on the site of injection. A large percentage of these latter projections was cholinergic. In the brainstem, the cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus was retrogradely labelled after all thalamic injections, suggesting that it provides a widespread innervation to the thalamus. Neurons of the cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental nucleus were retrogradely labelled after injections into the anterior, laterodorsal, central medial, and mediodorsal nuclei, suggesting that it provides a projection to limbic components of the thalamus. Significant basal forebrain labelling occurred only with injections into the reticular and mediodorsal nuclei. Only injections into the reticular nucleus resulted in retrograde labelling of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The results provide evidence for an organized system of thalamic afferents arising from cholinergic and noncholinergic structures in the brainstem and basal forebrain. The brainstem structures, especially the cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, appear to project directly to principal thalamic nuclei, thereby providing a possible anatomical substrate for mediating the well-known facilitory effects of brainstem stimulation upon thalamocortical transmission.},

Recent studies have dramatically confirmed these predictions. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus contains GABAergic and galaninergic neurons that are active during sleep and are necessary for normal sleep. The posterior lateral hypothalamus contains orexin/hypocretin neurons that are crucial for maintaining normal wakefulness. A model is proposed in which wake- and sleep-promoting neurons inhibit each other, which results in stable wakefulness and sleep. Disruption of wake- or sleep-promoting pathways results in behavioral state instability.},

  abstract = {The brain contains autochthonous neural systems that evoke waking from sleep in response to sensory stimuli, prolong or enhance arousal in response to special stimuli, and also generate and maintain wakefulness regardless of sensory stimuli during the active part of the day. Through ascending projections to the cortex, these arousal systems stimulate cortical activation, characterized by high frequency gamma and low frequency rhythmic theta activity, and through descending projections to the spinal cord, they stimulate muscle tonus along with sensory-motor responsiveness and activity. They are comprised of neuronal aggregates within the brainstem reticular formation, thalamus, posterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain, and they utilize multiple different neurotransmitters. Within the brainstem, neurons of the reticular formation, which predominantly utilize glutamate as a neurotransmitter, stimulate cortical activation by exciting the widespread projecting neurons of the nonspecific thalamo-cortical projection system, which similarly utilize glutamate, and neurons of the ventral extra-thalamic relay systems located in the posterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain, many of which also utilize glutamate. In addition, these systems have descending projections by which they can enhance or modulate muscle tonus and activity. Articulating with these are cholinergic neurons of the ponto-mesencephalic tegmentum and basal forebrain that promote cortical activation during waking and also during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), in association therein with muscle atonia. Dopaminergic ventral mesencephalic neurons stimulate a highly motivated and positively rewarding state during waking and may also do so during REMS. In contrast, noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons promote an aroused waking state and prevent REMS as well as slow wave sleep (SWS). Serotonergic raphe neurons promote a seemingly quiet or satiated waking state, which though exclusive of REMS, can actually be conducive to SWS. Histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus act like noradrenergic neurons in enforcing waking and are joined by neurons in the region that contain orexin, a neuropeptide recently shown to maintain waking and in absentia to be responsible for narcolepsy, or the inability to maintain wakefulness. These multiple arousal systems are grossly redundant, since no one system is absolutely necessary for the occurrence of waking; yet they are differentiated, since each plays a special role in waking and sleep. During SWS, they are submitted to an inhibitory influence arising in part at least from particular GABAergic neurons co-distributed with many neurons of the arousal systems and also concentrated within the basal forebrain and adjacent preoptic region.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous discharge of norepinephrine-containing locus coeruleus (NE-LC) neurons was examined during the sleep-walking cycle (S-WC) in behaving rats. Single unit and multiple unit extracellular recordings yielded a consistent set of characteristic discharge properties. (1) Tonic discharge co-varied with stages of the S-WC, being highest during waking, lower during slow wave sleep, and virtually absent during paradoxical sleep. (2) Discharge anticipated S-WC stages as well as phasic cortical activity, such as spindles, during slow wave sleep. (3) Discharge decreased within active waking during grooming and sweet water consumption. (4) Bursts of impulses accompanied spontaneous or sensory-evoked interruptions of sleep, grooming, consumption, or other such ongoing behavior. (5) These characteristic discharge properties were topographically homogeneous for recordings throughout the NE-LC. (6) Phasic robust activity was synchronized markedly among neurons in multiple unit populations. (7) Field potentials occurred spontaneously in the NE-LC and were synchronized with bursts of unit activity from the same electrodes. (8) Field potentials became dissociated from unit activity during paradoxical sleep, exhibiting their highest rates in the virtual absence of impulses. These results are generally consistent with previous proposals that the NE-LC system is involved in regulating cortical and behavioral arousal. On the basis of the present data and those described in the following report (Aston-Jones, G., and F. E. Bloom (1981) J. Neurosci.1: 887-900), we conclude that these neurons may mediate a specific function within the general arousal framework. In brief, the NE-LC system may globally bias the responsiveness of target neurons and thereby influence overall behavioral orientation.},

  abstract = {The sleep-waking discharge patterns of neurons in the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PLH) were investigated in the rat. Previous studies in the cat demonstrated that this region contained neurons that fired tonically at low rates (2-4 Hz) during waking, decreased firing in non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep and nearly ceased firing during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep. These "REM-off" neurons were proposed to be histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TM). Since many anatomical and physiological studies are performed in the rat, we sought to examine the sleep-waking discharge of these neurons in this animal. We found three main types of discharge patterns among PLH neurons. Waking-related neurons decreased their discharge in NREM sleep, and remained at low rates during REM sleep. A subpopulation of these neurons discharged very little during REM sleep ({$<$}0.2 Hz) (REM-off neurons). Waking/REM-related neurons decreased their discharge in NREM sleep and returned to waking rates in REM sleep. REM-related neurons decreased their discharge in NREM sleep and increased their discharge during REM sleep higher than waking rates. No NREM-related discharge patterns were recorded. Waking-related and waking/REM-related neurons were similar in location within the PLH and action potential duration. Some REM-off and other waking-related neurons were recorded within the boundaries of the histaminergic TM, however, not all waking-related and REM-off neurons were found within this region. Furthermore, neurons with waking/REM-related and state-indifferent discharge patterns were localized within the TM. These results suggest that waking-related and/or REM-off neurons may not be exclusively histaminergic in rats.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peptidergic neurons containing the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and the hypocretins (or orexins) are intermingled in the zona incerta, perifornical nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area. Both types of neurons have been implicated in the integrated regulation of energy homeostasis and body weight. Hypocretin neurons have also been involved in sleep-wake regulation and narcolepsy. We therefore sought to determine whether hypocretin and MCH neurons express Fos in association with enhanced paradoxical sleep (PS or REM sleep) during the rebound following PS deprivation. Next, we compared the effect of MCH and NaCl intracerebroventricular (ICV) administrations on sleep stage quantities to further determine whether MCH neurons play an active role in PS regulation.
RESULTS: Here we show that the MCH but not the hypocretin neurons are strongly active during PS, evidenced through combined hypocretin, MCH, and Fos immunostainings in three groups of rats (PS Control, PS Deprived and PS Recovery rats). Further, we show that ICV administration of MCH induces a dose-dependent increase in PS (up to 200\%) and slow wave sleep (up to 70\%) quantities.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MCH is a powerful hypnogenic factor. MCH neurons might play a key role in the state of PS via their widespread projections in the central nervous system.},

By recording basal forebrain units in association with electroencephalographic activity across the sleep-wake cycle and labeling individual neurons with Neurobiotin for immunohistochemical identification, we show for the first time that cholinergic neurons discharge in bursts at maximal rates during active waking and paradoxical sleep, when gamma and theta electroencephalographic activity are maximal. They virtually cease firing during slow-wave sleep. Notably, their bursting discharge is synchronized with theta oscillations. Through their maximal firing and rhythmic theta discharge during active waking and paradoxical sleep, the cholinergic neurons can thus modulate the cortex to promote activation along with plasticity during these two states.},

We examined the effects on sleep behavior in rats of cell-specific damage to the VLPO by microinjection of ibotenic acid. Severe lesions of the central cell cluster of the VLPO ( approximately 80-90\% cell loss bilaterally) caused a 60-70\% decrease in delta power and a 50-60\% decrease in nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep time (p {$<$} 0.001). The number of remaining Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the VLPO cell cluster was linearly related to NREM sleep time (r = 0.77; p {$<$} 0.001) and total electroencephalogram delta power (r = 0. 79; p {$<$} 0.001) but not to rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (r = 0.35; p {$>$} 0.10). Lesions in the region containing scattered VLPO neurons medial or dorsal to the cell cluster caused smaller changes in NREM sleep time (24.5 or 15\%, respectively) but were more closely associated with loss of REM sleep (r = 0.74; p {$<$} 0.01). The insomnia caused by bilateral VLPO lesions persisted for at least 3 weeks. Lesions of the VLPO caused no change in mean body temperature or its circadian variation; after small lesions of the ventromedial preoptic nucleus, body temperature showed normal circadian variation but a wider temperature range, and sleep behavior was not affected. These experiments delineate distinct preoptic sites with primary effects on the regulation of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and body temperature.},

In both experiments, Fos expression in histaminergic neurons of all three TMN subnuclei was higher during periods of wakefulness.

These results led us to examine whether neurons in the extended VLPO are activated during REM sleep and the connectivity of these neurons with pontine sites implicated in producing REM sleep: the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and locus ceruleus (LC). After periods of dark exposure that triggered enrichment of REM sleep, the number of Fos-positive cells in the extended VLPO was highly correlated with REM but not NREM sleep. In contrast, the number of Fos-positive cells in the VLPO cluster was correlated with NREM but not REM sleep. Sixty percent of sleep-active cells in the extended VLPO and 90\% of sleep-active cells in the VLPO cluster in dark-treated animals contained galanin mRNA. Retrograde tracing from the LDT, DRN, and LC demonstrated more labeled cells in the extended VLPO than the VLPO cluster, and 50\% of these in the extended VLPO were sleep-active. Anterograde tracing showed that projections from the extended VLPO and VLPO cluster targeted the cell bodies and dendrites of DRN serotoninergic neurons and LC noradrenergic neurons but were not apposed to cholinergic neurons in the LDT. The connections and physiological activity of the extended VLPO suggest a specialized role in the regulation of REM sleep.},

To identify pathways that may influence sleep, we examined afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), an area critically implicated in promoting sleep. Injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the VLPO produced modest numbers of CTB-labeled monoaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and ventrolateral medulla, as well as a few neurons in the locus coeruleus. Immunohistochemistry for monoaminergic markers showed dense innervation of the VLPO by histaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic fibers. Along with previous findings, these results suggest that the VLPO and monoaminergic nuclei may be reciprocally connected. Retrograde and anterograde tracing showed moderate or heavy inputs to the VLPO from hypothalamic regions including the median preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), autonomic regions including the infralimbic cortex and parabrachial nucleus, and limbic regions including the lateral septal nucleus and ventral subiculum. Light to moderate inputs arose from orexin and melanin concentrating hormone neurons, but cholinergic or dopaminergic inputs were extremely sparse. Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) projections to the VLPO were sparse, but the heavy input to the VLPO from the DMH, which receives direct and indirect SCN inputs, could provide an alternate pathway regulating the circadian timing of sleep. These robust pathways suggest candidate mechanisms by which sleep may be influenced by brain systems regulating arousal, autonomic, limbic, and circadian functions.},

Identification of the VLPO in other species has been complicated by the lack of a marker for this cell population, other than the expression of Fos during sleep. We now report that a high percentage of the sleep-active (Fos-expressing) VLPO neurons express mRNA for the inhibitory neuropeptide, galanin, in nocturnal rodents (mice and rats), diurnal rodents (degus), and cats. A homologous (i.e. galanin mRNA-containing cell group) is clearly distinguishable in the ventrolateral region of the preoptic area in diurnal and nocturnal monkeys, as well as in humans. Galanin expression may serve to identify sleep-active neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area of the mammalian brain. The VLPO appears to be a critical component of sleep circuitry across multiple species, and we hypothesize that shrinkage of the VLPO with advancing age may explain sleep deficits in elderly humans.},

  doi = {10.1093/sleep/27.7.1307},
  abstract = {CONTEXT: Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes. The circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), regulates the timing and consolidation of the sleep-wake cycle, while a homeostatic mechanism governs the accumulation of sleep debt and sleep recovery. Recent studies using mice with deletions or mutations of circadian genes show that components of the circadian pacemaker can influence the total amount of baseline sleep and recovery from sleep deprivation, indicating a broader role for the SCN in sleep regulation.
OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the role of the circadian pacemaker in sleep regulation in mice, we recorded sleep in sham and SCN-lesioned mice under baseline conditions and following sleep deprivation.
RESULTS: Compared to sham controls, SCN-lesioned mice exhibited a decrease in sleep consolidation and a decrease in wakefulness during the dark phase. Following sleep deprivation, SCN-lesioned mice exhibited an attenuated increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep time but an increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalographic delta power that was similar to that of the sham controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the SCN consolidate the sleep-wake cycle by generating a signal of arousal during the subjective night (ie. the active period), thereby having the capacity to alter baseline sleep amount. Although the SCN are not involved in sleep homeostasis as defined by the increase in electroencephalographic delta power after sleep deprivation, the SCN does play a central role in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness beyond just the timing of vigilance states.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in the late 1950s, identification of the neural circuitry underlying wakefulness, sleep onset and the alternation between REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep has been an active area of investigation. Synchronization and desynchronization of cortical activity as detected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is due to a corticothalamocortical loop, intrinsic cortical oscillators, monoaminergic and cholinergic afferent input to the thalamus, and the basal forebrain cholinergic input directly to the cortex. The monoaminergic and cholinergic systems are largely wake-promoting; the brainstem cholinergic nuclei are also involved in REM sleep regulation. These wake-promoting systems receive excitatory input from the hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin system. Sleep-promoting nuclei are GABAergic in nature and found in the preoptic area, brainstem and lateral hypothalamus. Although the pons is critical for the expression of REM sleep, recent research has suggested that melanin-concentrating hormone/GABAergic cells in the lateral hypothalamus "gate" REM sleep. The temporal distribution of sleep and wakefulness is due to interaction between the circadian system and the sleep homeostatic system. Although the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the circadian pacemaker, the neural circuitry underlying the sleep homeostat is less clear. Prolonged wakefulness results in the accumulation of extracellular adenosine, possibly from glial sources, which is an important feedback molecule for the sleep homeostatic system. Cortical neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) neurons may also play a role in propagating slow waves through the cortex in NREM sleep. Several neuropeptides and other neurochemicals likely play important roles in sleep/wake control. Although the control of sleep and wakefulness seemingly involves multiple redundant systems, each of these systems provides a vulnerability that can result in sleep/wake dysfunction that may predispose to physical and/or neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {The efferent projections of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCh) in the rat hypothalamus have been reexamined with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), which displays labeled axons with the clarity of a Golgi impregnation. Fibers from the SCh can be divided into six pathways for descriptive purposes. By far the densest terminal field arising from cells in the SCh ends in a roughly comma-shaped zone between the SCh and paraventricular nucleus on the one hand and the periventricular nucleus and anterior hypothalamic area on the other. A few axons continue dorsally from this "subparaventricular zone" to pass through parvicellular parts of the paraventricular nucleus and the overlying midline thalamic nuclei to end in midrostrocaudal parts of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and a larger number continue caudally to end in the dorsomedial nucleus, dorsal parts of the cell-sparse zone surrounding the ventromedial nucleus, and the posterior hypothalamic area. The other five pathways all consist of relatively small numbers of fibers and give rise to relatively sparse terminal fields. The second pathway consists of rostrally directed fibers that end in ventral parts of the medial preoptic area and anteroventral periventricular nucleus. The third consists of anterodorsally oriented fibers that pass through the medial preoptic nucleus and adjacent regions to end ventrally in the intermediate lateral septal nucleus. The fourth consists of fibers just caudal to the third group that end in the preoptic continuation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as well as in the parataenial nucleus and rostral part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. The fifth consists of laterally directed fibers that course over the optic tract to end in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus. And the sixth consists of fibers that course posteriorally through the anterior hypothalamic and retrochiasmatic areas to end in the cell-sparse zone between the arcuate nucleus and ventral parts of the ventromedial nucleus, as well as in adjacent parts of the lateral hypothalamic area. The distribution of projections labeled following PHA-L injections centered in the subparaventricular zone was also examined and was confirmed with retrograde tracer experiments (Watts and Swanson: J. Comp. Neurol. 258:230-252, '87). The results indicate that the subparaventricular zone projects to essentially the same regions as the SCh, only much more densely, and also sends fibers back to the SCh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Light exposure can cascade numerous effects on the human circadian process via the non-imaging forming system, whose spectral relevance is highest in the short-wavelength range. Here we investigated if commercially available compact fluorescent lamps with different colour temperatures can impact on alertness and cognitive performance.
METHODS: Sixteen healthy young men were studied in a balanced cross-over design with light exposure of 3 different light settings (compact fluorescent lamps with light of 40 lux at 6500K and at 2500K and incandescent lamps of 40 lux at 3000K) during 2 h in the evening.
RESULTS: Exposure to light at 6500K induced greater melatonin suppression, together with enhanced subjective alertness, well-being and visual comfort. With respect to cognitive performance, light at 6500K led to significantly faster reaction times in tasks associated with sustained attention (Psychomotor Vigilance and GO/NOGO Task), but not in tasks associated with executive function (Paced Visual Serial Addition Task). This cognitive improvement was strongly related with attenuated salivary melatonin levels, particularly for the light condition at 6500K.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of the human alerting and cognitive response to polychromatic light at levels as low as 40 lux, is blue-shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system. Thus, the selection of commercially available compact fluorescent lights with different colour temperatures significantly impacts on circadian physiology and cognitive performance at home and in the workplace.},

  abstract = {There are two ways in which an animal can confine its behavior to a nocturnal or diurnal niche. One is to synchronize an endogenous clock that in turn controls the sleep-wake cycle. The other is to respond directly to illumination with changes in activity. In mice, high illumination levels suppress locomotion (negative masking) and low illumination levels enhance locomotion (positive masking). To investigate the role of the newly discovered opsin-like protein melanopsin in masking, we used 1 h and 3 h pulses of light given in the night, and also a 3.5:3.5 h light-dark (LD) cycle. Mice lacking the melanopsin gene had normal enhancement of locomotion in the presence of dim lights but an impaired suppression of locomotion in the presence of bright light. This impairment was evident only with lights in the order of 10 lux or brighter. This suggests that melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells is involved in masking, as it is in pupil contraction and phase shifts. Melanopsin is especially important in maintaining masking responses over long periods.},

It now appears that masking can be used to cover a far wider range of problems than was originally intended. To separate masking effects from the effects due to an internal oscillator, several techniques have been used. Such protocols, however, like the constant routine protocol, often replace one form of masking by another. The situation becomes even more complex when one realizes that the output of an internal oscillator modifies the input. The question might be asked whether it is possible to study the properties of the internal oscillator in vivo at all. This article attempts to produce a framework for future discussions.},

These processes require the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), but the relevant downstream brain areas involved remain elusive. ipRGCs project widely in the brain, including to the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Here we show that body temperature and sleep responses to acute light exposure are absent after genetic ablation of all ipRGCs except a subpopulation that projects to the SCN. Furthermore, by chemogenetic activation of the ipRGCs that avoid the SCN, we show that these cells are sufficient for acute changes in body temperature. Our results challenge the idea that the SCN is a major relay for the acute effects of light on non-image forming behaviors and identify the sensory cells that initiate light's profound effects on body temperature and sleep.},

We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02:00 and 06:00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences to studies of elephant sleep in captivity are noted, and specific factors shaping sleep architecture in elephants, on various temporal scales, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Among primates, the suborder Haplorhini is considered to have evolved a consolidated monophasic sleep pattern, with diurnal species requiring a shorter sleep duration than nocturnal species. Only a few primate species have been systematically studied in their natural habitat where environmental variables, including temperature and light, have a major influence on sleep and activity patterns. Here we report the first sleep study on a nocturnal primate performed in the wild. We fitted seven wild Javan slow lorises (Nycticebus javanicus) in West Java, Indonesia with accelerometers that collected activity data, and installed climate loggers in each individual’s home range to collect ambient temperature readings~(over 321 days in total). All individuals showed a strictly nocturnal pattern of activity and displayed a striking synchronisation of onset and cessation of activity in relation to sunset and sunrise. The longest consolidated rest episodes were typically clustered near the beginning and towards the end of the light period, and this pattern was inversely related to daily fluctuations of the ambient temperature. The striking relationship between daily activity patterns, light levels and temperature suggests a major role of the environment in shaping the daily architecture of waking and sleep. We concluded that well-known phenotypic variability in daily sleep amount and architecture across species may represent an adaptation to changes in the environment. Our data suggest that the consolidated monophasic sleep patterns shaped by environmental pressures observed in slow lorises represent phylogenetic inertia in the evolution of sleep patterns in humans.},

  doi = {10.1007/7854_2014_301},
  abstract = {In the last decades a substantial knowledge about sleep mechanisms has been accumulated. However, the function of sleep still remains elusive. The difficulty with unraveling sleep's function may arise from the lack of understanding of how the multitude of processes associated with waking and sleep-from gene expression and single neuron activity to the whole brain dynamics and behavior-functionally and mechanistically relate to each other. Therefore, novel conceptual frameworks, which integrate and take into account the variety of phenomena occurring during waking and sleep at different levels, will likely lead to advances in our understanding of the function of sleep, above and beyond what merely descriptive or correlative approaches can provide. One such framework, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, focuses on wake- and sleep-dependent changes in synaptic strength. The core claim of this hypothesis is that learning and experience during wakefulness are associated with a net increase in synaptic strength. In turn, the proposed function of sleep is to provide synaptic renormalization, which has important implications with respect to energy needs, intracranial space, metabolic supplies, and, importantly, enables further plastic changes. In this article we review the empirical evidence for this hypothesis, which was obtained at several levels-from gene expression and cellular excitability to structural synaptic modifications and behavioral outcomes. We conclude that although the mechanisms behind the proposed role of sleep in synaptic homeostasis are undoubtedly complex, this conceptual framework offers a unique opportunity to provide mechanistic and functional explanation for many previously disparate observations, and define future research strategies.},

Although these cells fired at a rate 31.3\% higher during active waking than during quiet waking, their activity displayed no correlation with phasic elevations of the nuchal EMG or overt body movements. In addition, no relationship was observed between the activity of these neurons during slow-wave sleep and the occurrence of sleep spindles in the cortical EEG or pontogeniculooccipital waves recorded from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Serotonergic neurons of nucleus raphe magnus were also relatively unresponsive to phasic auditory and visual stimuli, with about half of the cells examined showing weak excitatory responses. These neurons did respond, however, to the administration of a small dose of the serotonin specific agonist, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (250 micrograms/kg, i.m.) with a mean decrease in unit activity of 73.6 +/- 4.5\%.

To learn how orexin neurons maintain wakefulness, we recorded neurons in head-fixed rats across the sleep-waking cycle and then labeled them with Neurobiotin to identify them by immunohistochemistry. We show that identified orexin neurons discharge during active waking, when postural muscle tone is high in association with movement, decrease discharge during quiet waking in absence of movement, and virtually cease firing during sleep, when postural muscle tone is low or absent. During PS, they remain relatively silent in association with postural muscle atonia and most often despite phasic muscular twitches. They increase firing before the end of PS and thereby herald by several seconds the return of waking and muscle tone. The orexin neurons would thus stimulate arousal, while antagonizing sleep and muscle atonia.},

Mood regulation by light, on the other hand, requires an SCN-independent pathway linking ipRGCs to a previously unrecognized thalamic region, termed perihabenular nucleus (PHb). The PHb is integrated in a distinctive circuitry with mood-regulating centers and is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior. Together, these results provide new insights into the neural basis required for light to influence mood and learning.},

  abstract = {Previous research on humans and animals suggests that the analysis of sleep patterns may reliably inform us about welfare status, but little research of this kind has been carried out for non-human animals in an applied context. This study explored the use of sleep and resting behaviour as indicators of welfare by describing the activity patterns of dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) housed in rescue shelters, and comparing their sleep patterns to other behavioural and cognitive measures of welfare. Sleep and activity patterns were observed over five non-consecutive days in a population of 15 dogs. Subsequently, the characteristics of sleep and resting behaviour were described and the impact of activity on patterns of sleep and resting behaviour analysed. Shelter dogs slept for 2.8\% of the day, 14.3\% less than previously reported and experienced less sleep fragmentation at night (32 sleep bouts). There were no statistically significant relationships between behaviours exhibited during the day and sleep behaviour. A higher proportion of daytime resting behaviour was significantly associated with a positive judgement bias, less repetitive behaviour and increased time spent coded as ‘relaxed’ across days by shelter staff. These results suggest that, in the context of a busy shelter environment, the ability to rest more during the day could be a sign of improved welfare. Considering the non-linear relationship between sleep and welfare in humans, the relationship between sleep and behavioural indicators of welfare, including judgement bias, in shelter dogs may be more complex than this study could detect.},

  abstract = {The use of animals is essential in biomedical research. The laboratory environment where the animals are housed has a major impact on them throughout their lives and influences the outcome of animal experiments. Therefore, there has been an increased effort in the refinement of laboratory housing conditions which is explicitly reflected in international regulations and recommendations. Since housing conditions affect behaviour and brain function as well as well-being, the validation of an animal model or paradigm to study the brain and central nervous system disorders is not complete without an evaluation of its implication on animal welfare. Here we discuss several aspects of animal welfare, comparing groups of six rats living in the PhenoWorld (PhW), a recently developed and validated paradigm for studying rodent behaviour, with standard-housed animals (in cages of six rats or pair-housed). In this study we present new data on home-cage behaviour showing that PhW animals have a clearer circadian pattern of sleep and social interaction. We conclude that, by promoting good basic health and functioning, together with the performance of natural behaviours, and maintaining animals’ control over some of their environment but still keeping some physical and social challenges, the PhW stimulates positive affective states and higher motivation in rats, which might contribute to an increased welfare for animals living in the PhW.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and regulate a wide array of light-dependent physiological processes. Genetic ablation of ipRGCs eliminates circadian photoentrainment and severely disrupts the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Here we show that ipRGCs consist of distinct subpopulations that differentially express the Brn3b transcription factor, and can be functionally distinguished. Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs innervate all other known brain targets, including the olivary pretectal nucleus. Consistent with these innervation patterns, selective ablation of Brn3b-positive ipRGCs severely disrupts the PLR, but does not impair circadian photoentrainment. Thus, we find that molecularly distinct subpopulations of M1 ipRGCs, which are morphologically and electrophysiologically similar, innervate different brain regions to execute specific light-induced functions.},

  abstract = {The temporal organization of sleep is regulated by an interaction between the circadian clock and homeostatic processes. Light indirectly modulates sleep through its ability to phase shift and entrain the circadian clock. Light can also exert a direct, circadian-independent effect on sleep. For example, acute exposure to light promotes sleep in nocturnal animals and wake in diurnal animals. The mechanisms whereby light directly influences sleep and arousal are not well understood. In this review, we discuss the direct effect of light on sleep at the level of the retina and hypothalamus in rodents. We review murine data from recent publications showing the roles of rod-, cone- and melanopsin-based photoreception on the initiation and maintenance of light-induced sleep. We also present hypotheses about hypothalamic mechanisms that have been advanced to explain the acute control of sleep by light. Specifically, we review recent studies assessing the roles of the ventrolateral preoptic area and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We also discuss how light might differentially promote sleep and arousal in nocturnal and diurnal animals respectively. Lastly, we suggest new avenues for research on this topic which is still in its early stages.},

We measured this modulation simultaneously in multiple cortical areas by imaging mice expressing voltagesensitive ﬂuorescent proteins (VSFP). VSFP imaging estimates local membrane potential across large portions of cortex. We used temporal ﬁlters to predict local potential from running speed or from pupil dilation, two measures of arousal. The ﬁlters provided good ﬁts and revealed that the effects of arousal depend on modality. In the primary visual cortex (V1) and auditory cortex (Au), arousal caused depolarization followed by hyperpolarization. In the barrel cortex (S1b) and a secondary visual area (LM), it caused only hyperpolarization. In all areas, nonetheless, arousal reduced the phasic responses to trains of sensory stimuli. These results demonstrate diverse effects of arousal across sensory cortex but similar effects on sensory responses.},

  abstract = {Functional infrared thermal imaging (fITI) is considered a promising method to measure emotional autonomic responses through facial cutaneous thermal variations. However, the facial thermal response to emotions still needs to be investigated within the framework of the dimensional approach to emotions. The main aim of this study was to assess how the facial thermal variations index the emotional arousal and valence dimensions of visual stimuli. Twenty-four participants were presented with three groups of standardized emotional pictures (unpleasant, neutral and pleasant) from the International Affective Picture System. Facial temperature was recorded at the nose tip, an important region of interest for facial thermal variations, and compared to electrodermal responses, a robust index of emotional arousal. Both types of responses were also compared to subjective ratings of pictures. An emotional arousal effect was found on the amplitude and latency of thermal responses and on the amplitude and frequency of electrodermal responses. The participants showed greater thermal and dermal responses to emotional than to neutral pictures with no difference between pleasant and unpleasant ones. Thermal responses correlated and the dermal ones tended to correlate with subjective ratings. Finally, in the emotional conditions compared to the neutral one, the frequency of simultaneous thermal and dermal responses increased while both thermal or dermal isolated responses decreased. Overall, this study brings convergent arguments to consider fITI as a promising method reflecting the arousal dimension of emotional stimulation and, consequently, as a credible alternative to the classical recording of electrodermal activity. The present research provides an original way to unveil autonomic implication in emotional processes and opens new perspectives to measure them in touchless conditions.},

They are especially evident in long-term records of behavioral state in polyphasic animals such as rodents. However, few attempts have been made to incorporate ultradian rhythmicity into models of sleep-wake dynamics, and little is known about the physiological mechanisms that give rise to ultradian rhythms in sleep-wake state. This study investigated ultradian dynamics in sleep and wakefulness in rats entrained to a 12-h:12-h light-dark cycle (LD) and in rats whose circadian rhythms were suppressed and free-running following long-term exposure to uninterrupted bright light (LL). We recorded sleep-wake state continuously for 7 to 12 consecutive days and used time-series analysis to quantify the dynamics of net cumulative time in each state (wakefulness [WAKE], rapid eye movement sleep [REM], and non-REM sleep [NREM]) in each animal individually. Form estimates and autocorrelation confirmed the presence of significant ultradian and circadian rhythms; maximum entropy spectral analysis allowed high-resolution evaluation of multiple periods within the signal, and wave-by-wave analysis enabled a statistical evaluation of the instantaneous period, peak-trough range, and phase of each ultradian wave in the time series. Significant ultradian periodicities were present in all 3 states in all animals. In LD, ultradian range was approximately 28\% of circadian range. In LL, ultradian range was slightly reduced relative to LD, and circadian range was strongly attenuated. Ultradian rhythms were found to be quasiperiodic in both LD and LL. That is, ultradian period varied randomly around a mean of approximately 4 h, with no relationship between ultradian period and time of day.},

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of constant darkness (DD) or constant light (LL) on the daily distribution and amounts of sleep-wake stages, cerebral temperature and concentrations of the urinary melatonin metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, in prolactin-deficient rats. After 3 weeks of DD, the SWS period was 24 h 8+/-6 min and the acrophase occurred at 15:44+/-1:35, while for PS, the period was more stable than during LD (24 h 10+/-8 min vs. 24 h 55+/-43 min) and the acrophase occurred at 16:44+/-1:54. Under LL conditions, circadian sleep rhythms persisted during the first 3 days, then completely disappeared during the third week, to be replaced by ultradian rhythms (period of 4-6 h). Time-series analysis showed that the two sleep states became synchronous as early as the second day under constant conditions. The total amount of PS was increased under both conditions (LL and DD) at the expense of duration of waking. Under LD and constant conditions, the pattern of changes in cerebral temperature was similar to that for wakefulness (W). Sulfatoxymelatonin was rhythmically secreted under both LD and DD conditions, whereas, under LL conditions, its rhythm was abolished. The results show that, in IPL rats in the absence of a zeitgeber, the PS and SWS rhythms recover a synchronous phase relationship and PS amounts are increased.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to simultaneously measure temperature and sleep in the rat under continuous illumination in an attempt to reveal properties of the underlying circadian oscillators. At first, the circadian rhythms of temperature and wake free-ran in parallel. Within weeks or months, circadian arrhythmicity developed in most animals. Both circadian rhythms eventually damped out, even at fairly low light intensities. The circadian rhythm of wake was weaker and disintegrated sooner than the circadian rhythm of temperature. Although the data did not rule out control by separate circadian oscillators, one for temperature and one for wake, a single oscillator model was sufficient to explain this phenomenon. Ultradian variations with a period of about 2–5 hr were superimposed upon the circadian rhythms. When the circadian rhythms damped out, the ultradian variations remained. The ultradian bursts of wake preceded the ultradian bursts of temperature, suggesting a causal relationship. On the other hand, the circadian rhythm of temperature could not be dependent on the circadian rhythm of wakefulness, because the temperature rhythm could persist while the wake rhythm was absent.},

  abstract = {Two groups of rats were maintained on a 12 hr light-12 hr darkness (L12-D12) schedule. One was subjected to continuous light and the other to continuous darkness for 3 weeks and then returned to the original schedule. Rats placed in continuous light, initially showed a marked decrement in both rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and slow wave sleep (SWS) time. A dissociation developed later between the sleep stages; REMS time remained below baseline but SWS time increased above it. In recovery (L12-D12), a temporary increase of REMS time above baseline was observed. During the first 2 weeks of continuous darkness REMS time increased 30\% and REMS/total sleep (\%-REMS) increased 17\%. Both measures returned to baseline during the third week of darkness. In recovery (L12-D12), REMS decreased 37\% and \%-REMS decreased 18\%. Changes in SWS time paralleled those in REMS time in direction but were proportionately smaller relative to baseline values. It is proposed that light stimulation inhibits REMS in the rat whereas darkness is the preferred and, whenever possible, the utilized condition for elaboration of REMS. Rats housed under long-term exposure to L12-D12 schedules develop and maintain a chronic REMS debt though daily REMS values return to normal. Prolonged darkness seems to be necessary for a complete REMS rebound. The possibility that light inhibits SWS as well as REMS is also considered. The effects of the lighting environment on the stages of sleep are interpreted within the larger context of the rat's life style.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. The vigilance states (waking, slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS)) and motor activity were continuously recorded by telemetry in unrestrained rats. The animals were first maintained for 2–3 days under 12-h light — 12-h dark (LD 12∶12) control conditions, and then exposed for 6–9 days to one of the 3 following schedules: skeleton photoperiods (SP), continuous darkness (DD) or continuous light (LL). The SP-schedule consisted of continuous darkness except for 2 daily 20-min light-periods situated at the beginning and at the end of the previous 12-h light-phase. 2. The period (τ) of the circadian activity rhythm increased to approximately 25 h in LL, but remained generally close to 24 h in SP and DD (Table 1). The amplitude (A) of the circadian rhythms was more attenuated by LL than by the two other schedules (Table 2). The value for A was generally larger for PS or motor activity than for waking and SWS. 3. The daily amount of motor activity was significantly increased in DD (Table 3). Activity tended to be increased also in SP, and PS in both SP and DD, while SWS tended to be reduced during these schedules. The daily amount of PS as well as the percentage of PS relative to total sleep (PS/TS) were significantly increased in LL, while the amount of waking was significantly reduced. This increase of PS to 117.3\% of the control level was mainly due to a more frequent occurrence of PS-episodes (Table 4). 4. In SP and DD, motor activity and waking were higher during the circadian phase of low activity (ρ) than during the light-phase of the control days, and lower during the circadian phase of high activity (α) than during the dark-phase of the control days (Fig. 5). The demarcation of α andρ were distinct in SP and DD, and less well defined in LL (Figs. 1–3). Nevertheless, basic features of the circadian patterns persisted under all experimental conditions. They include (a) a skewed distribution of activity and waking, with a maximum towards the end of α, and a low level at the beginning ofρ (Fig. 5); (b) an increasing trend of PS/TS duringρ (Fig. 5); and (c) a decreasing trend in the duration of SWS-episodes duringρ (Fig. 6). 5. We conclude that the circadian patterns of the vigilance states and motor activity as well as the differences in the distribution of SWS and PS, are mainly due to endogenous processes, and are influenced only to a minor extent by the 24-h LD-cycle.},

  abstract = {An important factor in reducing variability in mouse test outcomes has been to develop assays that can be used for continuous automated home cage assessment. Our experience has shown that this has been most evidenced in long-term assessment of wheel-running activity in mice. Historically, wheel-running in mice and other rodents have been used as a robust assay to determine, with precision, the inherent period of circadian rhythms in mice. Furthermore, this assay has been instrumental in dissecting the molecular genetic basis of mammalian circadian rhythms. In teasing out the elements of this test that have determined its robustness – automated assessment of an unforced behaviour in the home cage over long time intervals – we and others have been investigating whether similar test apparatus could be used to accurately discriminate differences in distinct behavioural parameters in mice. Firstly, using these systems, we explored behaviours in a number of mouse inbred strains to determine whether we could extract biologically meaningful differences. Secondly, we tested a number of relevant mutant lines to determine how discriminative these parameters were. Our findings show that, when compared to conventional out-of-cage phenotyping, a far deeper understanding of mouse mutant phenotype can be established by monitoring behaviour in the home cage over one or more light:dark cycles.},

Most organisms have developed endogenously driven circadian rhythms which are synchronized to this daily light/dark cycle. In recent years, humans have shifted away from the naturally occurring solar light cycle in favor of artificial and sometimes irregular light schedules produced by electrical lighting. Exposure to unnatural light cycles is increasingly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome; however the means by which environmental lighting alters metabolism are poorly understood. Thus, we exposed mice to nighttime light and investigated changes in the circadian system and body weight. Here we report that exposure to ecologically relevant levels of dim (5 lux) light at night attenuate core circadian clock rhythms in the SCN at both the gene and protein level. Moreover, circadian clock rhythms were perturbed in the liver by nighttime light exposure. Changes in the circadian clock were associated with temporal alterations in feeding behavior and increased weight gain. These results are significant because they provide mechanistic evidence for how mild changes in environmental lighting can alter circadian and metabolic function.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoids (corticosterone in birds and rodents and cortisol in all other mammals) are glucoregulatory hormones that are synthesized in response to a range of stimuli including stress and are regularly measured in the assessment of animal welfare. Glucocorticoids have many normal or non-stress-related functions, and glucocorticoid synthesis can increase in response to pleasure, excitement, and arousal as well as fear, anxiety, and pain. Often, when assessing animal welfare, little consideration is given to normal non-stress-related glucocorticoid functions or the complex mechanisms that regulate the effects of glucocorticoids on physiology. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that increased glucocorticoid synthesis can indicate positive welfare states or that a stress response can increase fitness and improve the welfare of an animal. In this paper, we review how and when glucocorticoid synthesis increases, the actions mediated through type I and type II glucocorticoid receptors, the importance of corticosteroid-binding globulin, the role of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and the key aspects of neurophysiology relevant to activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This is discussed in the context of animal welfare assessment, particularly under the biological functioning and affective states frameworks. We contend that extending the assessment of animal welfare to key brain regions afferent to the hypothalamus and incorporating the aspects of glucocorticoid physiology that affect change in target tissue will advance animal welfare science and inspire more comprehensive assessment of the welfare of animals.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoids, hormones produced by the adrenal gland cortex, perform numerous functions in body homeostasis and the response of the organism to external stressors. One striking feature of their regulation is a diurnal release pattern, with peak levels linked to the start of the activity phase. This release is under control of the circadian clock, an endogenous biological timekeeper that acts to prepare the organism for daily changes in its environment. Circadian control of glucocorticoid production and secretion involves a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as a circadian clock in the adrenal gland itself. Central circadian regulation is mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system, while the adrenal gland clock appears to control sensitivity of the gland to the adrenocorticopic hormone (ACTH). The rhythmically released glucocorticoids in turn might contribute to synchronisation of the cell-autonomous clocks in the body and interact with them to time physiological dynamics in their target tissues around the day.},

  abstract = {Plasma levels of corticosterone exhibit both circadian and ultradian rhythms. The circadian component of these rhythms is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Our studies investigate the importance of the SCN in regulating ultradian rhythmicity. Two approaches were used to dissociate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis from normal circadian input in rats: (i) exposure to a constant light (LL) environment and (ii) electrolytic lesioning of the SCN. Blood was sampled using an automated sampling system. As expected, both treatments resulted in a loss of the circadian pattern of corticosterone secretion. Ultradian pulsatile secretion of corticosterone however, was maintained across the 24 h in all animals. Furthermore, the loss of SCN input revealed an underlying relationship between locomotor and HPA activity. In control (LD) rats there was no clear correlation between ultradian locomotor activity and hormone secretion, whereas, in LL rats, episodes of ultradian activity were consistently followed by periods of increased pulsatile hormone secretion. These data clearly demonstrate that the ultradian rhythm of corticosterone secretion is generated through a mechanism independent of the SCN input, supporting recent evidence for a sub-hypothalamic pulse generator.},

Results of studies with continuous light exposure are less clear, because of short exposure durations and single-variable monitoring. This study sought to characterize properties of the oscillator(s) controlling the rat's circadian system by monitoring both body temperature and locomotor activity. We observed that prolonged exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats to continuous light (LL) systematically induced complete suppression of body temperature and locomotor activity circadian rhythms and their replacement by ultradian rhythms. This was preceded by a transient loss of coupling between both functions. Continuous darkness (DD) restored circadian synchronization of temperature and activity circadian rhythms within 1 wk. The absence of circadian rhythms in LL coincided with a mean sixfold decrease in plasma melatonin and a marked dampening but no abolition of its circadian rhythmicity. Restoration of temperature and activity circadian rhythms in DD was associated with normalization of melatonin rhythm. These results demonstrated a transient internal desynchronization of two simultaneously monitored functions in the rat and suggested the existence of two or more circadian oscillators. Such a hypothesis was further strengthened by the observation of a circadian rhythm in melatonin, despite complete suppression of body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms. This rat model should be useful for investigating the physiology of the circadian timing system as well as to identify agents and schedules having specific pharmacological actions on this system.},

We therefore investigated whether loss of rhythms in behavior was due to arrhythmia within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN tissue samples were obtained at 6 time points across 24 h in constant darkness from entrained and arrhythmic hamsters, and per1, per2 , bmal1, and cry1 mRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The light treatment eliminated circadian expression of clock genes within the SCN, and the overall expression of these genes was reduced by 18\% to 40\% of entrained values. Arrhythmia in per1, per2, and bmal1 was due to reductions in the amplitudes of their oscillations. We suggest that these data are compatible with an amplitude suppression model in which light induces singularity in the molecular circadian pacemaker.},

  abstract = {The influence of light on mammalian physiology and behavior is due to the entrainment of circadian rhythms complemented with a direct modulation of light that would be unlikely an outcome of circadian system. In mammals, physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. This central control allows organisms to predict and anticipate environmental change, as well as to coordinate different rhythmic modalities within an individual. In adult mammals, direct retinal projections to the SCN are responsible for resetting and synchronizing physiological and behavioral rhythms to the light-dark (LD) cycle. Apart from its circadian effects, light also has direct effects on certain biological functions in such a way that the participation of the SCN would not be fundamental for this network. The objective of this review is to increase awareness, within the scientific community and commercial providers, of the fact that laboratory rodents can experience a number of adverse health and welfare outcomes attributed to commonly-used lighting conditions in animal facilities during routine husbandry and scientific procedures, widely considered as "environmentally friendly." There is increasing evidence that exposure to dim light at night, as well as chronic constant darkness, challenges mammalian physiology and behavior resulting in disrupted circadian rhythms, neural death, a depressive-behavioral phenotype, cognitive impairment, and the deregulation of metabolic, physiological, and synaptic plasticity in both the short and long terms. The normal development and good health of laboratory rodents requires cyclical light entrainment, adapted to the solar cycle of day and night, with null light at night and safe illuminating qualities during the day. We therefore recommend increased awareness of the limited information available with regards to lighting conditions, and therefore that lighting protocols must be taken into consideration when designing experiments and duly highlighted in scientific papers. This practice will help to ensure the welfare of laboratory animals and increase the likelihood of producing reliable and reproducible results.},

According to rapidly developing models, the core oscillator driving this clock is composed of an autoregulatory transcription-(post) translation-based feedback loop involving a set of 'dock' genes. Molecular clocks do not oscillate with an exact 24-hour rhythmicity but are entrained to solar day/night rhythms by light. The mammalian proteins Cryl and Cry2, which are members of the family of plant blue-light receptors (cryptochromes) and photolyases, have been proposed as candidate light receptors for photoentrainment of the biological clock. Here we show that mice lacking the Cryl or Cry2 protein display accelerated and delayed free-running periodicity of locomotor activity, respectively. Strikingly, in the absence of both proteins, an instantaneous and complete loss of free-running rhythmicity is observed. This suggests that, in addition to a possible photoreceptor and antagonistic clock-adjusting function, both proteins are essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity.},

Such rhythmic return through a cycle of change is an ubiquitous principle of organization in living systems. In this revised and updated edition the author plans to extend the thread from 1980 to the present concentrating on areas which he personally feels have been interesting and where he feels there will be much activity in the future. This involves going through spatial biochemical, electrophysiological, and organismic dynamical systems and patterns that were discovered by pursuing the theme of phase singularities that the original book introduced. In particular the work on excitability in cell membranes has been thoroughly updated as have the references throughout the book.},

Here, we report a real-time in vivo fluorescence recording system that enables long-term monitoring of circadian rhythms in the brains of freely moving mice. With a designed reporter of circadian clock gene expression, we tracked robust Cry1 transcription reporter rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of WT, Cry1−/−, and Cry2−/− mice in LD (12 h light, 12 h dark) and DD (constant darkness) conditions and verified that signals remained stable for over 6 mo. Further, we recorded Cry1 transcriptional rhythms in the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) and hippocampal CA1/2 regions of WT mice housed under LD and DD conditions. By using a Cre-loxP system, we recorded Per2 and Cry1 transcription rhythms specifically in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons of the SCN. Finally, we demonstrated the dynamics of Per2 and Cry1 transcriptional rhythms in SCN VIP neurons following an 8-h phase advance in the light/dark cycle.},

There are many different techniques and algorithms for determining period, all with different assumptions and with differing levels of complexity. Choosing which algorithm, which implementation and which measures of accuracy to use can offer many pitfalls, especially for the non-expert. We have developed the BioDare system, an online service allowing data-sharing (including public dissemination), data-processing and analysis. Circadian experiments are the main focus of BioDare hence performing period analysis is a major feature of the system. Six methods have been incorporated into BioDare: Enright and Lomb-Scargle periodograms, FFT-NLLS, mFourfit, MESA and Spectrum Resampling. Here we review those six techniques, explain the principles behind each algorithm and evaluate their performance. In order to quantify the methods' accuracy, we examine the algorithms against artificial mathematical test signals and model-generated mRNA data. Our re-implementation of each method in Java allows meaningful comparisons of the computational complexity and computing time associated with each algorithm. Finally, we provide guidelines on which algorithms are most appropriate for which data types, and recommendations on experimental design to extract optimal data for analysis.},

How these self-sustained cellular clocks achieve multicellular integration and thereby direct daily rhythms of behavior in animals is largely obscure. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the fulcrum of this pathway from gene to cell to circuit to behavior in mammals. We describe cell type-specific, functionally distinct TTFLs in neurons and astrocytes of the SCN and show that, in the absence of other cellular clocks, the cell-autonomous astrocytic TTFL alone can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and circadian behavior in mice. Astrocytic clocks achieve this by reinstating clock gene expression and circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic signals. Our results demonstrate that astrocytes can autonomously initiate and sustain complex mammalian behavior.},

Despite numbering only about 10,000 neurons on each side of the third ventricle, the SCN is our principal circadian clock, directing the daily cycles of behaviour and physiology that set the tempo of our lives. When this nucleus is isolated in organotypic culture, its autonomous timing mechanism can persist indefinitely, with precision and robustness. The discovery of the cell-autonomous transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops that drive circadian activity in the SCN provided a powerful exemplar of the genetic specification of complex mammalian behaviours. However, the analysis of circadian time-keeping is moving beyond single cells. Technical and conceptual advances, including intersectional genetics, multidimensional imaging and network theory, are beginning to uncover the circuit-level mechanisms and emergent properties that make the SCN a uniquely precise and robust clock. However, much remains unknown about the SCN, not least the intrinsic properties of SCN neurons, its circuit topology and the neuronal computations that these circuits support. Moreover, the convention that the SCN is a neuronal clock has been overturned by the discovery that astrocytes are an integral part of the timepiece. As a test bed for examining the relationships between genes, cells and circuits in sculpting complex behaviours, the SCN continues to offer powerful lessons and opportunities for contemporary neuroscience.},

Previous studies have shown that T cycles - light-dark (LD) cycles differing from 24\,h - lead to acute changes in the daily amount and distribution of waking and sleep. However, little is known about the long-term effects of T cycles. Here we performed continuous 10\,day recording of electroencephalography (EEG), locomotor activity and core body temperature in C57BL/6 mice under a T20 cycle, to investigate spontaneous sleep and waking at baseline compared with when the circadian clock was misaligned and then re-aligned with respect to the external LD cycle. We found that the rhythmic distribution of sleep was abolished during misalignment, while the time course of EEG slow wave activity (1-4\,Hz) was inverted compared to baseline. Although the typical light-dark distribution of NREM sleep was re-instated when animals were re-aligned, slow wave activity during NREM sleep showed an atypical increase in the dark phase, suggesting a long-term effect of T cycles on sleep intensity. Our data show that circadian misalignment results in previously uncharacterised long-term effects on sleep, which may have important consequences for behaviour.},

This study tested whether α compression in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) impaired their spatial working memory as assessed by spontaneous alternation (SA) behavior in a T-maze. Animals were exposed to a 1- or 3-h phase delay of the LD cycle (16 h light: 8 h dark). SA behavior was tested at four multi-day intervals after the phase shift and α was quantified for those days. All of the animals failed at the SA task while α was decompressing, but recovered spatial memory ability once α returned to baseline levels. A second experiment exposed hamsters to a 2-h light pulse either early or late at night to compress α without phase-shifting the LD cycle. SA behavior was impaired until α decompressed to baseline levels. In a third experiment, α was compressed by changing photoperiod (LD 16:8, 18:6, 20:4) to see if absolute differences in α were related to spatial memory ability. Animals performed the SA task successfully in all three photoperiods. These data show that the dynamic process of α compression and decompression impairs spatial working memory and suggests that α modulation is a potential biomarker for assessing the impact of transmeridian flight or shift work on memory.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze (MWM) is a test of spatial learning for rodents that relies on distal cues to navigate from start locations around the perimeter of an open swimming arena to locate a submerged escape platform. Spatial learning is assessed across repeated trials and reference memory is determined by preference for the platform area when the platform is absent. Reversal and shift trials enhance the detection of spatial impairments. Trial-dependent, latent and discrimination learning can be assessed using modifications of the basic protocol. Search-to-platform area determines the degree of reliance on spatial versus non-spatial strategies. Cued trials determine whether performance factors that are unrelated to place learning are present. Escape from water is relatively immune from activity or body mass differences, making it ideal for many experimental models. The MWM has proven to be a robust and reliable test that is strongly correlated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity and NMDA receptor function. We present protocols for performing variants of the MWM test, from which results can be obtained from individual animals in as few as 6 days.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.cortex.2017.05.016},
  abstract = {Many theories of declarative memory propose that it is supported by partially separable processes underpinned by different brain structures. The hippocampus plays a critical role in binding together item and contextual information together and processing the relationships between individual items. By contrast, the processing of individual items and their later recognition can be supported by extrahippocampal regions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), particularly when recognition is based on feelings of familiarity without the retrieval of any associated information. These theories are domain-general in that "items" might be words, faces, objects, scenes, etc. However, there is mixed evidence that item recognition does not require the hippocampus, or that familiarity-based recognition can be supported by extrahippocampal regions. By contrast, there is compelling evidence that in humans, hippocampal damage does not affect recognition memory for unfamiliar faces, whilst recognition memory for several other stimulus classes is impaired. I propose that regions outside of the hippocampus can support recognition of unfamiliar faces because they are perceived as discrete items and have no prior conceptual associations. Conversely, extrahippocampal processes are inadequate for recognition of items which (a) have been previously experienced, (b) are conceptually meaningful, or (c) are perceived as being comprised of individual elements. This account reconciles findings from primate and human studies of recognition memory. Furthermore, it suggests that while the hippocampus is critical for binding and relational processing, these processes are required for item recognition memory in most situations.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythmicity in humans has been well studied using actigraphy, a method of measuring gross motor movement. As actigraphic technology continues to evolve, it is important for data analysis to keep pace with new variables and features. Our objective is to study the behavior of two variables, interdaily stability and intradaily variability, to describe rest activity rhythm. Simulated data and actigraphy data of humans, rats, and marmosets were used in this study. We modified the method of calculation for IV and IS by modifying the time intervals of analysis. For each variable, we calculated the average value (IVm and ISm) results for each time interval. Simulated data showed that (1) synchronization analysis depends on sample size, and (2) fragmentation is independent of the amplitude of the generated noise. We were able to obtain a significant difference in the fragmentation patterns of stroke patients using an IVm variable, while the variable IV60 was not identified. Rhythmic synchronization of activity and rest was significantly higher in young than adults with Parkinson׳s when using the ISM variable; however, this difference was not seen using IS60. We propose an updated format to calculate rhythmic fragmentation, including two additional optional variables. These alternative methods of nonparametric analysis aim to more precisely detect sleep–wake cycle fragmentation and synchronization.},

In Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), the dysregulation of both sleep-wake behavior and melatonin production strongly suggests impaired non-visual light perception. We discovered that mice haploinsufficient for the SMS causal gene, Retinoic acid induced-1 (Rai1), were hypersensitive to light such that light eliminated alert and active-wake behaviors, while leaving time-spent-awake unaffected. Moreover, variables pertaining to circadian rhythm entrainment were activated more strongly by light. At the input level, the activation of rod/cone and suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) by light was paradoxically greatly reduced, while the downstream activation of the ventral-subparaventricular zone (vSPVZ) was increased. The vSPVZ integrates retinal and SCN input and, when activated, suppresses locomotor activity, consistent with the behavioral hypersensitivity to light we observed. Our results implicate Rai1 as a novel and central player in processing non-visual light information, from input to behavioral output., DOI:

  abstract = {Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic and a circadian process. Together these two processes determine most aspects of sleep and related variables like sleepiness and alertness. The two processes are known to be able to work independently, but also to both influence sleep and sleep related variables in an additive or more complex manner. The question remains whether the two processes are directly influencing each other. The present review summarizes evidence from behavioural and electroencephalographic determined sleep, electrophysiology, gene knock out mouse models, and mathematical modelling to explore whether sleep homeostasis can influence circadian clock functioning and vice versa. There is a multitude of data available showing parallel action or influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms and the circadian clock on several objective and subjective variables related to sleep and alertness. However, the evidence of a direct influence of the circadian clock on sleep homeostatic mechanisms is sparse and more research is needed, particularly applying longer sleep deprivations that include a second night. The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high. The available data indicate that a strong central clock will induce periods of deep sleep, which in turn will strengthen clock function. Both are therefore important for health and wellbeing. Weakening of one will also hamper functioning of the other. Shift work and jet lag are situations where one tries to adapt to zeitgebers in a condition where sleep is compromised. Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.},

  abstract = {24h rhythms of physiology and behavior are driven by the environment and an internal endogenous timing system. Daily restricted feeding (RF) in nocturnal rodents during their inactive phase initiates food anticipatory activity (FAA) and a reorganisation of the typical 24h sleep-wake structure. Here, we investigate the effects of daytime feeding, where food access was restricted to 4h during the light period ZT4-8 (Zeitgeber time; ZT0 is lights on), on sleep-wake architecture and sleep homeostasis in mice. Following 10 days of RF, mice were returned to ad libitum feeding. To mimic the spontaneous wakefulness associated with FAA and daytime feeding, mice were then sleep deprived between ZT3-6. While the amount of wake increased during FAA and subsequent feeding, total wake time over 24h remained stable as the loss of sleep in the light phase was compensated for by an increase in sleep in the dark phase. Interestingly, sleep which followed spontaneous wake episodes during the dark period and the extended period of wake associated with FAA, exhibited lower levels of slow-wave activity (SWA) when compared to baseline or after sleep deprivation, despite a similar duration of waking. This suggests an evolutionary mechanism of reducing sleep drive during negative energy balance to enable greater arousal for food seeking behaviors. However, the total amount of sleep and SWA accumulated during the 24h was similar between baseline and RF. In summary, our study suggests that despite substantial changes in the daily distribution and quality of wake induced by RF, sleep homeostasis is maintained.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.5-4.0 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is a reliable indicator of sleep need, as it increases with the duration of prior wakefulness and decreases during sleep. However, which biologic process occurring during wakefulness is responsible for the increase of sleep SWA remains unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether neuronal plasticity underlies the link between waking activities and the SWA response.
DESIGN: We manipulated, in rats, the amount of exploratory activity while maintaining the total duration of waking constant. We then measured the extent to which exploration increases cortical expression of plasticity-related genes (BDNF, Arc, Homer, NGFI-A), and the SWA response once the animals were allowed to sleep.
SETTING: Basic neurophysiology and molecular laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Male Wistar Kyoto rats (250-300 g; 2-3 month old).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
RESULTS: We found that, within the same animal, the amount of exploratory behavior during wakefulness could predict the extent to which BDNF was induced, as well as the extent of the homeostatic SWA response during subsequent sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a direct link between the synaptic plasticity triggered by waking activities and the homeostatic sleep response and identifies BDNF as a major mediator of this link at the molecular level.},

Synchronization requires neuropeptide signaling, regulated by a reciprocal interdependence between the molecular clockwork and rhythmic electrical activity, which in turn depends on a daytime Na+ drive and nighttime K+ drag. Recent studies exploiting intersectional genetics have started to identify the pacemaking roles of particular neuronal groups in the SCN. They support the idea that timekeeping involves nonlinear and hierarchical computations that create and incorporate timing information through the interactions between key groups of neurons within the SCN circuit. The field is now poised to elucidate these computations, their underlying cellular mechanisms, and how the SCN clock interacts with subordinate circadian clocks across the brain to determine the timing and efficiency of the sleep–wake cycle, and how perturbations of this coherence contribute to neurological and psychiatric illness.},

As well as the widely-appreciated role of light in vision, light also plays a critical role in many non-visual responses, including regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, pupil constriction, heart rate, hormone release and learning and memory. In mammals, responses to light are all mediated via retinal photoreceptors, including the classical rods and cones involved in vision as well as the recently identified melanopsin-expressing photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Understanding the effects of light on the laboratory mouse therefore depends upon an appreciation of the physiology of these retinal photoreceptors, including their differing sens itivities to absolute light levels and wavelengths. The signals from these photoreceptors are often integrated, with different responses involving distinct retinal projections, making generalisations challenging. Furthermore, many commonly used laboratory mouse strains carry mutations that affect visual or non-visual physiology, ranging from inherited retinal degeneration to genetic differences in sleep and circadian rhythms. Here we provide an overview of the visual and non-visual systems before discussing practical considerations for the use of light for researchers and animal facility staff working with laboratory mice.},

  abstract = {Despite significant progress in elucidating the molecular basis for circadian oscillations, the neural mechanisms by which the circadian clock organizes daily rhythms of behavioral state in mammals remain poorly understood. The objective of this review is to critically evaluate a conceptual model that views sleep expression as the outcome of opponent processes-a circadian clock-dependent alerting process that opposes sleep during the daily wake period, and a homeostatic process by which sleep drive builds during waking and is dissipated during sleep after circadian alerting declines. This model is based primarily on the evidence that in a diurnal primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), ablation of the master circadian clock (the suprachiasmatic nucleus; SCN) induces a significant expansion of total daily sleep duration and a reduction in sleep latency in the dark. According to this model, the circadian clock actively promotes wake but only passively gates sleep; thus, loss of circadian clock alerting by SCN ablation impairs the ability to sustain wakefulness and causes sleep to expand. For comparison, two additional conceptual models are described, one in which the circadian clock actively promotes sleep but not wake, and a third in which the circadian clock actively promotes both sleep and wake, at different circadian phases. Sleep in intact and SCN-damaged rodents and humans is first reviewed, to determine how well the data fit these conceptual models. Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies are then reviewed, to examine the evidence for direct and indirect interactions between the SCN circadian clock and sleep-wake circuits. Finally, sleep in SCN-ablated squirrel monkeys is re-examined, to consider its compatibility with alternative models of circadian regulation of sleep. In aggregate, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence suggests that in rodents and humans, the circadian clock actively promotes both wake and sleep, at different phases of the circadian cycle. The hypersomnia of SCN-ablated squirrel monkeys is unique in magnitude, but is not incompatible with a role for the SCN pacemaker in actively promoting sleep.},

  abstract = {Summary
The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as a master circadian pacemaker, integrating environmental input to align physiological and behavioral rhythms to local time cues. Approximately 10\% of SCN neurons express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP); however, it is unknown how firing activity of VIP neurons releases VIP to entrain circadian rhythms. To identify physiologically relevant firing patterns, we optically tagged VIP neurons and characterized spontaneous firing over 3~days. VIP neurons had circadian rhythms in firing rate and exhibited two classes of instantaneous firing activity. We next tested whether physiologically relevant firing affected circadian rhythms through VIP release. We found that VIP neuron stimulation with high, but not low, frequencies shifted gene expression rhythms in~vitro through VIP signaling. In~vivo, high-frequency VIP neuron activation rapidly entrained circadian locomotor rhythms. Thus, increases in VIP neuronal firing frequency release VIP and entrain molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms.

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains the brain's circadian pacemaker, but mechanisms by which it controls circadian rhythms of sleep and related behaviors are poorly understood. Previous anatomic evidence has implicated the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) in circadian control of sleep, but this hypothesis remains untested. We now show that excitotoxic lesions of the DMH reduce circadian rhythms of wakefulness, feeding, locomotor activity, and serum corticosteroid levels by 78-89\% while also reducing their overall daily levels. We also show that the DMH receives both direct and indirect SCN inputs and sends a mainly GABAergic projection to the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and a mainly glutamate-thyrotropin-releasing hormone projection to the wake-promoting lateral hypothalamic area, including orexin (hypocretin) neurons. Through these pathways, the DMH may influence a wide range of behavioral circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {Individual neurons in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) contain an intracellular molecular clock and use intercellular signaling to synchronize their timekeeping activities so that the SCN can coordinate brain physiology and behavior. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and its VPAC2 receptor form a key component of intercellular signaling systems in the SCN and critically control cellular coupling. Targeted mutations in either the intracellular clock or intercellular neuropeptide signaling mechanisms, such as VIP-VPAC2 signaling, can lead to desynchronization of SCN neuronal clocks and loss of behavioral rhythms. An important goal in chronobiology is to develop interventions to correct deficiencies in circadian timekeeping. Here we show that extended exposure to constant light promotes synchrony among SCN clock cells and the expression of \textasciitilde{}24\,h rhythms in behavior in mice in which intercellular signaling is disrupted through loss of VIP-VPAC2 signaling. This study highlights the importance of SCN synchrony for the expression of rhythms in behavior and reveals how non-invasive manipulations in the external environment can be used to overcome neurochemical communication deficits in this important brain system.},

Therefore, we made simultaneous recordings of non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep (NREMS), rapid-eye-movement-sleep (REMS), brain temperature, intraperitoneal temperature, locomotion and drinking activity under light-dark (LD) and continuous dim illumination (dim LL) and analyzed their interrelations. The rhythmic patterns of body temperature, locomotion and drinking were modified on the 12th circadian day of dim LL, while the mean body temperature as well as mean occurrence of drinking and locomotor activities did not change significantly. In contrast, dim LL exposure significantly increased the total time spent in NREMS during the resting phase of dim LL and increased REMS episodes during the active phase of dim LL. The diverse effects of dim LL exposure on the recorded phenomena suggest that temporal patterns of sleep were the most sensitive to perturbations of lighting and that differential oscillatory mechanisms may regulate sleep and other circadian rhythms in the rat.},

The dynamics of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep can be described using the two-process model, whereby the parameters of homeostatic Process S are estimated using empirical EEG SWA (0.5–4 Hz) in nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), and the 24 hr distribution of vigilance states. We hypothesized that the influence of extrinsic factors on sleep homeostasis, such as the time of day or wake behavior, would manifest in systematic deviations between empirical SWA and model predictions. To test this hypothesis, we performed parameter estimation and tested model predictions using NREMS SWA derived from continuous EEG recordings from the frontal and occipital cortex in mice. The animals showed prolonged wake periods, followed by consolidated sleep, both during the dark and light phases, and wakefulness primarily consisted of voluntary wheel running, learning a new motor skill or novel object exploration. Simulated SWA matched empirical levels well across conditions, and neither waking experience nor time of day had a significant influence on the fit between data and simulation. However, we consistently observed that Process S declined during sleep significantly faster in the frontal than in the occipital area of the neocortex. The striking resilience of the model to specific wake behaviors, lighting conditions, and time of day suggests that intrinsic factors underpinning the dynamics of Process S are robust to extrinsic influences, despite their major role in shaping the overall amount and distribution of vigilance states across 24 hr.},

  abstract = {Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic (Process S) and a circadian component. The duration of prior wakefulness is the main factor influencing subsequent sleep duration and its intensity. We investigated in the rat whether the sleep-wake history before sleep deprivation (SD) contributes to the effects of sleep loss incurred during the SD. A 24-h baseline recording was followed by 6 h SD at light onset (SD-Light, n=7), or at dark onset (SD-Dark, n=8) and 18 h recovery. Both SDs led to a pronounced increase in slow wave activity (SWA, EEG power between 0.75 and 4.0 Hz) in NREM sleep and increased sleep consolidation. The prolongation of sleep episodes was associated with increased intra-episode SWA. The amount of waking before the SD correlated positively with the SWA increase during recovery, and SWA levels before SD were negatively correlated with their subsequent increase. The time-course of SWA (Process S) as well as of single frequency bins within the SWA band was successfully simulated based on vigilance-state distribution. The time constant of the exponential monotonic decay (Td) was higher for the 0.75-1.0 Hz bin compared to all remaining frequency bins of the SWA band, reflecting a slower process determining the slow EEG component during sleep. The data show that the homeostatic response after SD, consisting of increased sleep intensity and sleep consolidation is determined by a combination of SD and the preceding vigilance-state history. The slower dynamics of low frequency delta power compared to fast delta frequencies point to heterogeneity within the traditionally defined SWA band.},

  abstract = {Millions of people worldwide are required to work when their physiology is tuned for sleep. By forcing wakefulness out of the body’s normal schedule, shift workers face numerous adverse health consequences, including gastrointestinal problems, sleep problems, and higher rates of some diseases, including cancers. Recent studies have developed protocols to simulate shift work in rodents with the intention of assessing the effects of night-shift work on subsequent sleep (Grønli et al., 2017). These studies have already provided important contributions to the understanding of the metabolic consequences of shift work (Arble et al., 2015; Marti et al., 2016; Opperhuizen et al., 2015) and sleep-wake-specific impacts of night-shift work (Grønli et al., 2017). However, our understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying night-shift-related sleep disturbances is limited. In order to advance toward a mechanistic understanding of sleep disruption in shift work, we model these data with two different approaches. First we apply a simple homeostatic model to quantify differences in the rates at which sleep need, as measured by slow wave activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) rises and falls. Second, we develop a simple and novel mathematical model of rodent sleep and use it to investigate the timing of sleep in a simulated shift work protocol (Grønli et al., 2017). This mathematical framework includes the circadian and homeostatic processes of the two-process model, but additionally incorporates a stochastic process to model the polyphasic nature of rodent sleep. By changing only the time at which the rodents are forced to be awake, the model reproduces some key experimental results from the previous study, including correct proportions of time spent in each stage of sleep as a function of circadian time and the differences in total wake time and SWS bout durations in the rodents representing night-shift workers and those representing day-shift workers. Importantly, the model allows for deeper insight into circadian and homeostatic influences on sleep timing, as it demonstrates that the differences in SWS bout duration between rodents in the two shifts is largely a circadian effect. Our study shows the importance of mathematical modeling in uncovering mechanisms behind shift work sleep disturbances and it begins to lay a foundation for future mathematical modeling of sleep in rodents.},

In order to understand the molecular process underlying behavioral rhythms in LL or DD housing conditions, we examined the circadian profile of mPer2 mRNA and mPER2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a main oscillator, of free-running mice. The circadian expression rhythm of mPer2 in the SCN was dampened under 7-day LL conditions, whereas that of mPER2 protein was moderately attenuated and its expression peak delayed. The circadian expression of mPer2 and its product was slightly attenuated and advanced by 7-day DD conditions. With arrhythmic behavioral activity caused by long-term LL housing, mPER2 protein lost its rhythmicity in the SCN. On the other hand, LL or DD housing did not affect the mPer2 gene and its product in the cerebral cortex. The present results suggest that mPER2 circadian expression in the SCN corresponds well with behavioral circadian oscillation under LL or DD conditions. Thus, the behavioral circadian rhythm seems to correlate with molecular clock works in the SCN.},

Behavioral and (electro)-physiological measures of sleep clearly overlap in mammals and birds , but it is often unclear how these two relate in other vertebrates and invertebrates. Homeostatic regulation of sleep, where the amount of sleep depends on the amount of previous waking, can be observed in physiology and behavior in all animals this was tested in. In mammals and birds, sleep is generally subdivided into two states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. In mammals the combination of behavioral sleep and the changes in the slow-wave range of the NREM sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) can explain and predict the occurrence and depth of sleep in great detail. For REM sleep this is far less clear. Finally, the discovery that slow-waves in the NREM sleep EEG are influenced locally on the cortex depending on prior waking behavior is an interesting new development that asks for an adaptation of the concept of homeostatic regulation of sleep. Incorporating local sleep into models of sleep regulation is needed to obtain a comprehensive picture.},

Here we report the effect of voluntary wheel running during wakefulness on neuronal activity in the motor and somatosensory cortex in mice. We find that stereotypic wheel running is associated with a substantial reduction in firing rates among a large subpopulation of cortical neurons, especially at high speeds. Wheel running also has longer-term effects on spiking activity across periods of wakefulness. Specifically, cortical firing rates are significantly higher towards the end of a spontaneous prolonged waking period. However, this increase is abolished when wakefulness is dominated by running wheel activity. These findings indicate that wake-related changes in firing rates are determined not only by wake duration, but also by specific waking behaviours.},

  abstract = {According to the two-process model of sleep regulation, a homeostatic Process S increases during waking and decreases during sleep. The time course of Process S can be derived on the basis of changes in vigilance states and changes in electroencephalogram slow-wave activity (SWA, activity below 4 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In most mouse strains, an optimal fit between S and SWA was achieved with one increasing (active during waking and REM sleep) and one decreasing time constant (active during NREM sleep) for Process S. However, in the rat, systematic deviations in the light and dark periods were observed, which were resolved by introducing different decreasing time constants between the light and dark periods. The present study shows that this difference between the rest (light) and active (dark) phases remains, and may even be larger, after animals are adapted to constant dark conditions for at least a week. In addition, the data show that the build-up rate of SWA at the onset of a NREM sleep episode is slow compared with the increase rate under light-dark conditions, and that this build-up rate changes with the circadian phase. The slow build-up rate introduces a systematic error between the simulation of Process S and SWA in NREM sleep. The circadian modulation of the build-up rate may, together with circadian changes in NREM sleep episode duration, be the source of the necessity of introducing a difference in the decreasing time constant between the rest and active phases.},

Then we move to the simplest bilaterian animals (with a head, three body cell layers, and bilateral symmetry), the two phyla of flatworms. A key determinant of longevity and immortality in most of these simple animals is the large numbers of pluripotent stem cells that underlie the remarkable abilities of these animals to regenerate and rejuvenate themselves. Finally, we discuss briefly the evolution of the higher bilaterians and how longevity was reduced and immortality lost due to attainment of greater body complexity and cell cycle strategies that protect these complex organisms from developing tumors.

Environmental illumination profoundly influences human health and well-being. Recently discovered photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) are primary mediators of numerous circadian, neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral responses. pRGCs provide lighting information to diverse nonvisual (non-image-forming) brain centers including the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which serve as the body's master biological clock. The SCN exert functional control over circadian aspects of physiology. The timing and strength (amplitude) of SCN rhythmic signals are affected by light exposure. Light deficiency may attenuate SCN function and its control of physiological and hormonal rhythms which in turn can result in a cascade of adverse events. Inadequate pRGC photoreception cannot be perceived consciously, but may aggravate many common age-associated problems including insomnia, depression and impaired cognition. In this review we (1) summarize circadian physiology, emphasizing light's critical role as the most important geophysical timing cue in humans; (2) analyze evidence that typical residential lighting is insufficient for optimal pRGC requirements in youth and even more so with advancing age; (3) show how ocular aging and cataract surgery impact circadian photoreception; and (4) review some of the diverse morbidities associated with chronodisruption in general and those which may be caused by light deficiency in particular.},

  abstract = {The impact of aging on cell loss in the human retina was examined in foveal and temporal equatorial regions in eyes from 35 donors with ages spanning a 78-yr period from the second to the ninth decade of life. Equatorial cones and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) decreased at uniform rates from the second to the ninth decade, 16 and 14 cells/mm2/yr, respectively. Equatorial rods and cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) showed nonuniform rate decreases with age. The rates of rod and GCL cell loss were faster between the second and fourth decades (970 and 9 cells/mm2/yr, respectively) than between the fourth and ninth decades (570-330 and 6-3 cells/mm2/yr). The rod and GCL cell densities at the temporal equator maintained a constant ratio (rods-GCL cell ratio = 103 +/- 0.4, mean +/- standard deviation) and the same reduction slope ratio at different times during aging. Thus, the equatorial rod and GCL cell losses were correlated statistically. The ratio of equatorial photoreceptors to RPE cells showed no significant change with age, suggesting parallel loss of these closely apposed cells. At the foveal center, the variability of cone density between individuals in each decade grouping was large (1.7- to threefold). No significant differences were found in cone or RPE cell densities at the foveal center from the second to ninth decade, suggesting that the densities of foveal cones and RPE cells were stable throughout this period. Foveal RPE density was significantly higher than equatorial RPE density in each age group. No significant difference was found between the equatorial photoreceptor-RPE ratio and foveal cone-RPE ratio in any age group. Cells in the GCL in the fovea decreased by approximately 16\% from the second to the sixth decade. These results indicated that (1) rod photoreceptors and cells in the GCL were more vulnerable to loss during aging than cones; (2) photoreceptors and RPE cells showed parallel changes during aging; and (3) the photoreceptor loss accompanying aging was less pronounced in the fovea than in the peripheral retina.},

ambient light intensity at the eye level of the mice of 85 ± 18
lux. Scotopic single-flash and photopic-flicker electroretinograms
(ERGs) after complete dark adaptation were used to assess rod and cone
function, respectively. Numbers of rod photoreceptors were counted in
plastic sections, and rhodopsin levels were measured using absorption
difference spectrophotometry. Numbers and types of cones were
determined using lectin staining in retinal flatmounts and
cone-specific antibodies in radial frozen sections. Young pigmented
C57BL/6 and nonpigmented Balb/c mice had similar numbers of
rods. In both mouse strains, there was an overall decline in rod
photoreceptor number during aging, which was more pronounced in albino
mice. Rod cell numbers correlated with a drop in the overall amount of
rhodopsin and a reduction in the maximum a-wave of the rod
ERG. The number of short-wavelength cones was unaffected by age and
pigmentation, whereas an age-related decline was observed in
mid-wavelength (MWL) cones in albino, but not in pigmented mice. In
contrast, MWL cone function was reduced during aging in both strains.},

  abstract = {Circadian timing systems, like most physiological processes, cannot escape the effects of aging. With age, humans experience decreased duration and quality of sleep. Aged mice exhibit decreased amplitude and increased fragmentation of the activity rhythm, and lengthened circadian free-running period in both light-dark (LD) and constant dark (DD) conditions. Several studies have shown that aging impacts neural activity rhythms in the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). However, evidence for age-related disruption of circadian oscillations of clock genes in the SCN has been equivocal. We hypothesized that daily exposure to LD cycles masks the full impact of aging on molecular rhythms in the SCN. We performed ex vivo bioluminescent imaging of cultured SCN slices of young and aged PER2::luciferase knock-in (PER2::LUC) mice housed under LD or prolonged DD conditions. Under LD conditions, the amplitude of PER2::LUC rhythms differed only slightly between SCN explants from young and aged animals; under DD conditions, the PER2::LUC rhythms of aged animals showed markedly lower amplitudes and longer circadian periods than those of young animals. Recordings of PER2::LUC rhythms in individual SCN cells using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera revealed that aged SCN cells showed longer circadian periods and that the rhythms of individual cells rapidly became desynchronized. These data suggest that aging degrades the SCN circadian ensemble, but that recurrent LD cycles mask these effects. We propose that these changes reflect a decline in pacemaker robustness that could increase vulnerability to environmental challenges, and partly explain age-related sleep and circadian disturbances.},

  abstract = {With aging, various factors deteriorate the normal sleep process that is essential for the restoration of functional and physical performance. Due to aging-related diseases, life changes, or aging itself, disturbances in normal sleep cycles can profoundly affect healthy aging. To understand the interconnections between aging and the factors influencing sleep, with emerging evidence accumulated in recent years, this study elaborates on the roles of aging in sleep from four perspectives: cortical thinning, white matter degeneration, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and circadian disorganization. In brief, with aging, cortical thinning can be induced by the deposition of neurotoxic substances, and white matter degeneration can be induced by vascular abnormalities. These alterations emerging in the brain jointly disrupt sleep spindles and slow waves, leading to sleep disturbances. Age-related dysregulation in neurotransmitters (including galanin, orexin, serotonin, and adenosine) directly impairs the sleep modulation system. Disorganization in the circadian system consisting of suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction, reduced light transmission, and local circadian clock disruption collectively interrupts circadian rhythms, also causing sleep disturbances in the older. Of note is the bidirectional relationship between aging and sleep, which required us to examine this issue from different perspectives.},

Deficits in the function of the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have been implicated, but the responsible mechanisms have not been clearly delineated. In this report, we characterize the progression of rhythm deterioration in mice to 900 d of age. Longitudinal behavioral and sleep–wake recordings in up to 30-month-old mice showed strong fragmentation of rhythms, starting at the age of 700 d. Patch-clamp recordings in this age group revealed deficits in membrane properties and GABAergic postsynaptic current amplitude. A selective loss of circadian modulation of fast delayed-rectifier and A-type K+ currents was observed. At the tissue level, phase synchrony of SCN neurons was grossly disturbed, with some subpopulations peaking in anti-phase and a reduction in amplitude of the overall multiunit activity rhythm. We propose that aberrant SCN rhythmicity in old animals—with electrophysiological arrhythmia at the single-cell level and phase desynchronization at the network level—can account for defective circadian function with aging.},

  abstract = {The light-entrainable circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus regulates the timing and consolidation of sleep by generating a paradoxical rhythm of sleep propensity; the circadian drive for wakefulness peaks at the end of the day spent awake, ie close to the onset of melatonin secretion at 21.00-22.00 h and the circadian drive for sleep crests shortly before habitual waking-up time. With advancing age, ie after early adulthood, sleep consolidation declines, and time of awakening and the rhythms of body temperature, plasma melatonin and cortisol shift to an earlier clock hour. The variability of the phase relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms increases, and in old age sleep is more susceptible to internal arousing stimuli associated with circadian misalignment. The propensity to awaken from sleep advances relative to the body temperature nadir in older people, a change that is opposite to the phase delay of awakening relative to internal circadian rhythms associated with morningness in young people. Age-related changes do not appear to be associated with a shortening of the circadian period or a reduction of the circadian drive for wake maintenance. These changes may be related to changes in the sleep process itself, such as reductions in slow-wave sleep and sleep spindles as well as a reduced strength of the circadian signal promoting sleep in the early morning hours. Putative mediators and modulators of circadian sleep regulation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Humans show large inter-individual differences in organising their behaviour within the 24-h day-this is most obvious in their preferred timing of sleep and wakefulness. Sleep and wake times show a near-Gaussian distribution in a given population, with extreme early types waking up when extreme late types fall asleep. This distribution is predominantly based on differences in an individuals' circadian clock. The relationship between the circadian system and different "chronotypes" is formally and genetically well established in experimental studies in organisms ranging from unicells to mammals. To investigate the epidemiology of the human circadian clock, we developed a simple questionnaire (Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, MCTQ) to assess chronotype. So far, more than 55,000 people have completed the MCTQ, which has been validated with respect to the Horne-Østberg morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ), objective measures of activity and rest (sleep-logs and actimetry), and physiological parameters. As a result of this large survey, we established an algorithm which optimises chronotype assessment by incorporating the information on timing of sleep and wakefulness for both work and free days. The timing and duration of sleep are generally independent. However, when the two are analysed separately for work and free days, sleep duration strongly depends on chronotype. In addition, chronotype is both age- and sex-dependent.},

In this study, the genetic contribution to age-related changes in sleep was assessed in three inbred mouse strains of various ages. Baseline sleep and the response to 6 hours sleep deprivation (SD) achieved by gentle handling were quantified in young, middle-aged, and older male mice using electroencephalography. Total sleep time initially increased with age but then decreased in the oldest group mainly due to changes in sleep duration during the active phase. The effect of age on electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power depends on genotype and sleep pressure level with SD increasing the age-related differences. The strong effect of age upon the spectral profile of the different behavioral states was modulated by genetic background. Overall, our results suggest that sleep pressure can modulate the effect of age, that most sleep variables do not monotonically change with age in contrast to previous reports in humans and other species, and that genetic factors have a major impact on the aging processes affecting sleep.},

Multiple regression analyses showed that the partial correlations of the fragmentation of the sleep-wake rhythm with each of the three cognitive domains (r = -0.16, -0.19, and -0.16 respectively) were significant.

  abstract = {The circadian rhythm of core temperature depends upon several interacting rhythms, of both endogenous and exogenous origin, but an understanding of the process requires these two components to be separated. Constant routines remove the exogenous (masking) component at source, but they are severely limited in their application. By contrast, several purification methods have successfully reduced the masking component of overt circadian rhythms measured in field circumstances. One important, but incidental, outcome from these methods is that they enable a quantitative estimate of masking effects to be obtained. It has been shown that these effects of activity upon the temperature rhythm show circadian rhythmicity, and more detailed investigations of this have aided our understanding of thermoregulation and the genesis of the circadian rhythm of core temperature itself. The observed circadian rhythm of body temperature varies with age; in comparison with adults, it is poorly developed in the neonate and deteriorates in the aged subject. Comparing masked and purified data enables the reasons for these differences--whether due to the body clock, the effector pathways or organs, or irregularities due to the individual's lifestyle--to begin to be understood. Such investigations stress the immaturity of the circadian rhythm in the human neonate and its deterioration in elderly compared with younger subjects, but they also indicate the robustness of the body clock itself into advanced age, at least in mice.},

The rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) provides unique opportunities to explore the role of the clock in successful and unsuccessful physiological and cognitive aging in a diurnal primate with consolidated nighttime sleep, complex cognitive functions, long life span, and phylogenetic proximity to humans. A longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the effects of aging on the entrained and intrinsic circadian rhythms of activity, polysomnographic sleep patterns, and melatonin production in unrestrained male rhesus monkeys [6-9 (n=6) and 24-28 (n=4) years of age]. An age-dependent decline was found in the stability of circadian rhythms of activity and in peak melatonin levels. The range of individual intrinsic circadian periods (τ) is not age-dependent. Aged monkeys do not display clearly defined "morningness-eveningness" chronotypes and, unlike the young, show no correlation between the chronotype under entrained conditions and the length of intrinsic circadian period. The daily activity period (α) is reduced with age and this is associated with high day-to-day variability in sleep quantity and quality, fragmentation of nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness, increased daytime sleep time, overall increase in stage 1 sleep, and reduced time spent in rapid-eye movement and slow-wave sleep. In the absence of environmental time cues, age-dependent changes in sleep and circadian rhythms are exacerbated and circadian patterns of sleep in young rhesus monkeys start resembling those in aged animals, together suggesting important role of circadian regulation in aging sleep phenotype. This first characterization of age-dependent changes in the intrinsic rhythms and sleep in rhesus monkeys, demonstrating major similarities to human aging phenotype, should assist in the search for the mechanisms involved and for effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.},

We tried to find out whether there is a concurrent change in the output of the circadian pacemaker with age. The phase and amplitude of the pacemaker's output were assessed by continuous measurement of the core body temperature during 40 h of sustained wakefulness under constant behavioural and environmental conditions. 27 young men (18-31 years) were compared with 21 older people (65-85 years; 11 men, 10 women); all were healthy and without sleep complaints. The mean amplitude of the endogenous circadian temperature oscillation (ECA) was 40\% greater in young men than in the older group. Older men had a lower mean temperature ECA than older women. The minimum of the endogenous phase of the circadian temperature oscillation (ECP) occurred 1 h 52 min earlier in the older than in the young group. Customary bedtimes and waketimes were also earlier in the older group, as was their daily alertness peak. There was a close correlation between habitual waketime and temperature ECP in young men, which may lose precision with age, especially among women. These findings provide evidence for systematic age-related changes in the output of the human circadian pacemaker. We suggest that these changes may underlie the common complaints of sleep disturbance among elderly people. These changes could reflect the observed age-related deterioration of the hypothalamic nuclei that drive mammalian circadian rhythms.},

We also examined age-related changes in the daily rhythm of immunoreactivities for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons (SCN), two major peptides of the biological clock. Compared to adult animals, aged mouse lemurs showed a significant increase in daytime activity and an advanced activity onset. Moreover, when maintained in constant dim red light, aged animals exhibited a shortening of the free-running period compared to adult animals. In adults, AVP immunoreactivity (ir) peaked during the second part of the day, and VIP ir peaked during the night. In aged mouse lemurs, the peaks of AVP ir and VIP ir were significantly shifted with no change in amplitude. AVP ir was most intense at the beginning of the night; whereas, VIP ir peaked at the beginning of the daytime. A weakened oscillator could account for the rhythmic disorders often observed in the elderly. Changes in the daily rhythms of AVP ir and VIP ir may affect the ability of the SCN to transmit rhythmic information to other neural target sites, and thereby modify the expression of some biological rhythms.},

However, those observations were based on studies of humans exposed to light levels sufficient to confound circadian period estimation. Precise estimation of the periods of the endogenous circadian rhythms of melatonin, core body temperature, and cortisol in healthy young and older individuals living in carefully controlled lighting conditions has now revealed that the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker averages 24.18 hours in both age groups, with a tight distribution consistent with other species. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of disrupted sleep in older people.},

This variation in part could be due to epigenetic variation, which later affects the animal's physiology and ultimately longevity. Identification of the physiological properties that impact health and life span is crucial for longevity research and the development of anti-aging therapies. Here, we measured individual circadian and metabolic characteristics in a cohort of inbred F1 hybrid mice and correlated these parameters to their life spans. We found that mice with innate circadian periods close to 24 h (revealed during 30 days of housing in total darkness) enjoyed nearly 20\% longer life spans than their littermates, which had shorter or longer innate circadian periods. These findings show that maintenance of a 24-h intrinsic circadian period is a positive predictor of longevity. Our data suggest that circadian period may be used to predict individual longevity and that processes that control innate circadian period affect aging.},

  abstract = {The circadian clock has evolved to anticipate daily events and is assumed to be important for Darwinian fitness. The endogenous period of the clock runs close to 24 h, permitting accurate entrainment to the natural light/dark cycle. Circadian clocks with abnormal periods are therefore predicted to have negative consequences for fitness. We compared the fitness of mice with deviant circadian periods in populations living in a seminatural environment. Mice with near 24-h “resonant” rhythms survived longer and reproduced more than mice with rhythms shortened by a mutation in the circadian Ck1ε allele. Apart from the fundamental importance of such fitness effects in nature, this finding may have implications for humans subjected to circadian-rhythm deviations under abnormal work and lighting schedules., Circadian rhythms with an endogenous period close to or equal to the natural light–dark cycle are considered evolutionarily adaptive (“circadian resonance hypothesis”). Despite remarkable insight into the molecular mechanisms driving circadian cycles, this hypothesis has not been tested under natural conditions for any eukaryotic organism. We tested this hypothesis in mice bearing a short-period mutation in the enzyme casein kinase 1ε (tau mutation), which accelerates free-running circadian cycles. We compared daily activity (feeding) rhythms, survivorship, and reproduction in six replicate populations in outdoor experimental enclosures, established with wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice in a Mendelian ratio. In the release cohort, survival was reduced in the homozygote mutant mice, revealing strong selection against short-period genotypes. Over the course of 14 mo, the relative frequency of the tau allele dropped from initial parity to 20\%. Adult survival and recruitment of juveniles into the population contributed approximately equally to the selection for wild-type alleles. The expression of activity during daytime varied throughout the experiment and was significantly increased by the tau mutation. The strong selection against the short-period tau allele observed here contrasts with earlier studies showing absence of selection against a Period 2 (Per2) mutation, which disrupts internal clock function, but does not change period length. These findings are consistent with, and predicted by the theory that resonance of the circadian system plays an important role in individual fitness.},

  abstract = {For most species, aging promotes a host of degenerative pathologies that are characterized by debilitating losses of tissue or cellular function. However, especially among vertebrates, aging also promotes hyperplastic pathologies, the most deadly of which is cancer. In contrast to the loss of function that characterizes degenerating cells and tissues, malignant (cancerous) cells must acquire new (albeit aberrant) functions that allow them to develop into a lethal tumor. This review discusses the idea that, despite seemingly opposite characteristics, the degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies of aging are at least partly linked by a common biological phenomenon: a cellular stress response known as cellular senescence. The senescence response is widely recognized as a potent tumor suppressive mechanism. However, recent evidence strengthens the idea that it also drives both degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies, most likely by promoting chronic inflammation. Thus, the senescence response may be the result of antagonistically pleiotropic gene action.},

This study aims to examine whether shift work is associated with increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Methods We linked 28 731 female nurses (age ≥44 years), recruited in 1993 or 1999 from the Danish nurse cohort where they reported information on shift work (night, evening, rotating, or day), to the Danish Register of Causes of Death to identify deaths up to 2013. We used Cox regression models with age as the underlying scale to examine the associations between night, evening, and rotating shift work (compared to day shift work) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in models adjusted for potentially confounding variables. Results Of 18 015 nurses included in this study, 1616 died during the study time period from the following causes: cardiovascular disease (N=217), cancer (N= 945), diabetes (N=20), Alzheimer's disease or dementia (N=33), and psychiatric diseases (N=67). We found that working night [hazard ratio (HR) 1.26, 95\% confidence interval 95\% CI) 1.05-1.51] or evening (HR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.11-1.49) shifts was associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality when compared to working day shift. We found a significant association of night shift work with cardiovascular disease (HR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.09-2.69) and diabetes (HR 12.0, 95\% CI 3.17-45.2, based on 8 cases) and none with overall cancer mortality (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.81-1.35) or mortality from psychiatric diseases (HR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.47-2.92). Finally, we found strong association between evening (HR 4.28, 95\% CI 1.62-11.3) and rotating (HR 5.39, 95\% CI 2.35-12.3) shift work and mortality from Alzheimer's disease and dementia (based on 8 and 14 deaths among evening and rotating shift workers, respectively).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Melatonin shows potential oncostatic action, and light exposure during night suppresses melatonin production. There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.
METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95\% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95\% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift (RR = 1.36; 95\% CI = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P =.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.},

We also reviewed the reference lists from retrieved articles. Observational studies that reported relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between shift work and the risk of prostate cancer were included. Linear and non-linear dose-response meta-analyses were performed. Fifteen studies with 16 independent reports involving 2 546 822 individuals and 10 715 patients with prostate cancer were included. The pooled adjusted RR for the association between ever exposure to shift work and prostate cancer risk was 1.23 (95\% CI, 1.08-1.41; P {$<$} 0.001). A non-linear association of prostate cancer risk with duration of shift work was identified (P for non-linearity = 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher pooled RR of prostate cancer for studies among Asian populations (RR = 1.98, 95\% CI, 1.34-2.93; P = 0.618). A positive association was observed in rotating shift groups (RR = 1.10, 95\% CI, 1.00-1.26; P = 0.156), but not in other shift groups.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Night work is increasingly common and a necessity in certain sectors of the modern 24-h society. The embedded exposure to light-at-night, which suppresses the nocturnal hormone melatonin with oncostatic properties and circadian disruption, i.e., misalignment between internal and external night and between cells and organs, are suggested as main mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified shift work that involves circadian disruption as probably carcinogenic to humans based on limited evidence from eight epidemiologic studies on breast cancer, in addition to sufficient evidence from animal experiments. The aim of this review is a critical update of the IARC evaluation, including subsequent and the most recent epidemiologic evidence on breast cancer risk after night work.
RECENT FINDINGS: After 2007, in total nine new case-control studies, one case-cohort study, and eight cohort studies are published, which triples the number of studies. Further, two previous cohorts have been updated with extended follow-up. The assessment of night shift work is different in all of the 26 existing studies. There is some evidence that high number of consecutive night shifts has impact on the extent of circadian disruption, and thereby increased breast cancer risk, but this information is missing in almost all cohort studies. This in combination with short-term follow-up of aging cohorts may explain why some cohort studies may have null findings. The more recent case-control studies have contributed interesting results concerning breast cancer subtypes in relation to both menopausal status and different hormonal subtypes. The large differences in definitions of both exposure and outcome may contribute to the observed heterogeneity of results from studies of night work and breast cancer, which overall points in the direction of an increased breast cancer risk, in particular after over 20~years of night shifts. Overall, there is a tendency of increased risk of breast cancer either after over 20~years of night shift or after shorter periods with many consecutive shifts. More epidemiologic research using standardized definitions of night work metrics and breast cancer subtypes as well as other cancers is needed in order to improve the epidemiologic evidence in combination with animal models of night work. Also, evidence-based preventive interventions are needed.},

Altered circadian rhythms predict for poor survival in cancer patients. An increased incidence of several cancers has been reported in flight attendants and in shift workers. To explore the contribution of the CTS to tumor growth, we developed experimental models of disrupted or enhanced circadian coordination through stereotaxic destruction of the SCN, modifications of photoperiodic or feeding synchronizers and/or the administration of pharmacologic agents. SCN ablation or exposure to experimental chronic jetlag (CJL, consisting of an 8-hour advance of the light-dark cycle every 2 days) caused alterations in circadian physiology and significantly accelerated tumor growth. CJL suppressed or altered the rhythms of clock gene and cell cycle gene expression in mouse liver. It increased p53 and decreased c-Myc expression, a result in line with the promotion of diethylnitrosamine -initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in jet-lagged mice. The accelerating effect of CJL on tumor growth was counterbalanced by the regular timing of food access over the 24-h. Meal timing prevented the circadian disruption produced by CJL and slowed down tumor growth. In synchronized mice, meal timing reinforced host circadian coordination, phase-shifted the transcriptional rhythms of clock genes in the liver of tumor-bearing mice and slowed down cancer progression. These results support the role of the CTS in cancer progression and call for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or treating circadian clock dysfunctions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The circadian timing system rhythmically controls behavior, physiology, cellular proliferation and xenobiotic metabolism over the 24-h period. The suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus coordinate the molecular clocks in most mammalian cells through an array of circadian physiological rhythms including rest-activity, body temperature, feeding patterns and hormonal secretions. As a result, shift work that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic in humans. In experimental models, chronic jet-lag (CJL) suppresses rest-activity and body temperature rhythms and accelerates growth of two transplantable tumors in mice. CJL also suppresses or significantly alters the expression rhythms of clock genes in liver and tumors. Circadian clock disruption from CJL downregulates p53 and upregulates c-Myc, thus favoring cellular proliferation. Here, we investigate the role of CJL as a tumor promoter in mice exposed to the hepatic carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN).
METHODS: In experiment 1 (Exp 1), the dose-dependent carcinogenicity of chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of DEN was explored in mice. In Exp 2, mice received DEN at 10 mg/kg/day (cumulative dose: 243 mg/kg), then were randomized to remain in a photoperiodic regimen where 12 h of light alternates with 12 h of darkness (LD 12:12) or to be submitted to CJL (8-h advance of light onset every 2 days). Rest-activity and body temperature were monitored. Serum liver enzymes were determined repeatedly. Mice were sacrificed and examined for neoplastic lesions at 10 months.
RESULTS: In Exp 1, DEN produced liver cancers in all the mice receiving 10 mg/kg/day. In Exp 2, mice on CJL had increased mean plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase and more liver tumors as compared to LD mice at approximately 10 months (p = 0.005 and 0.028, respectively). The mean diameter of the largest liver tumor was twice as large in CJL vs LD mice (8.5 vs 4.4 mm, p = 0.027). In LD, a single histologic tumor type per liver was observed. In CJL, up to four different types were associated in the same liver (hepatocellular- or cholangio-carcinomas, sarcomas or mixed tumors). DEN itself markedly disrupted the circadian rhythms in rest-activity and body temperature in all the mice. DEN-induced disruption was prolonged for {$>$}or= 3 months by CJL exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of circadian disruption with chronic DEN exposure suggests that circadian clocks actively control the mechanisms of liver carcinogenesis in mice. Persistent circadian coordination may further be critical for slowing down and/or reverting cancer development after carcinogen exposure.},

Circadian rhythm disruption by shift work is associated with greater risk for cancer development and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeostasis. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the effects of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that both physiologic perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the central circadian clock components decreased survival and promoted lung tumor growth and progression. The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were shown to have cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive roles in transformation and lung tumor progression. Loss of the central clock components led to increased c-Myc expression, enhanced proliferation, and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic and somatic disruption of circadian rhythms contribute to cancer progression.},

  abstract = {Circadian clock is implicated in the regulation of aging. The transcription factor CLOCK, a core component of the circadian system, operates in complex with another circadian clock protein BMAL1. Recently it was demonstrated that BMAL1 deficiency results in premature aging in mice. Here we investigate the aging of mice deficient for CLOCK protein. Deficiency of the CLOCK protein significantly affects longevity: the average lifespan of Clock-/- mice is reduced by 15\% compared with wild type mice, while maximum lifespan is reduced by more than 20\%. CLOCK deficiency also results in the development of two age-specific pathologies in these mice, cataracts and dermatitis, at a much higher rate than in wild type mice. In contrast to BMAL1 deficient animals, Clock-/- mice do not develop a premature aging phenotype and do not develop the multiple age-associated pathologies characteristic of BMAL1 deficiency. Thus, although CLOCK and BMAL1 form a transcriptional complex, the physiological result of their deficiency is different. Our results suggest that CLOCK plays an important role in aging, specifically; CLOCK activity is critical for the regulation of normal physiology and aging of the lens and skin.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this review was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events associated with shift work and determine if there is a dose-response relationship in this association. Method Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for cohort or case-control control study designs in any population, reporting exposure to shift work as the main contributing factor to estimate CVD risk. For each study, adjusted relative risk (RR) ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted, and used to calculate the pooled RR using random-effect models. Meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. Potential non-linear dose-response relationships were examined using fractional polynomial models. Results We included 21 studies with a total of 173 010 unique participants. The majority of the studies were ranked low-to-moderate risk of bias. The risk of any CVD event was 17\% higher among shift workers than day workers. The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity was 26\% higher (1.26, 95\% CI 1.10-1.43, I 2= 48.0\%). Sub-group analysis showed an almost 20\% higher risk of CVD and CHD mortality among shift workers than those who did not work shifts (1.22, 95\% CI 1.09-1.37, I 2= 0\% and 1.18, 95\% CI 1.06-1.32 I 2=0\%; respectively). After the first five years of shift work, there was a 7.1\% increase in risk of CVD events for every additional five years of exposure (95\% CI 1.05-1.10). Heterogeneity of the pooled effect size (ES) estimates was high (I 2=67\%), and meta-regression analysis showed that sample size explained 7.7\% of this. Conclusions The association between shift work and CVD risk is non-linear and seems to appear only after the first five years of exposure. As shift work remains crucial for meeting production and service demands across many industries, policies and initiatives are needed to reduce shift workers' CVD risk.},

  abstract = {The circadian mechanism underlies daily rhythms in cardiovascular physiology and rhythm disruption is a major risk factor for heart disease and worse outcomes. However, the role of circadian rhythms is generally clinically unappreciated. Clock is a core component of the circadian mechanism and here we examine the role of Clock as a vital determinant of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology in aging. ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice develop age-dependent increases in heart weight, hypertrophy, dilation, impaired contractility, and reduced myogenic responsiveness. Young ClockΔ19/Δ19 hearts express dysregulated mRNAs and miRNAs in the PTEN-AKT signal pathways important for cardiac hypertrophy. We found a rhythm in the Pten gene and PTEN protein in WT hearts; rhythmic oscillations are lost in ClockΔ19/Δ19 hearts. Changes in PTEN are associated with reduced AKT activation and changes in downstream mediators GSK-3β, PRAS40, and S6K1. Cardiomyocyte cultures confirm that Clock regulates the AKT signalling pathways crucial for cardiac hypertrophy. In old ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice cardiac AKT, GSK3β, S6K1 phosphorylation are increased, consistent with the development of age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy. Lastly, we show that pharmacological modulation of the circadian mechanism with the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces AKT activation and heart weight in old WT mice. Furthermore, SR9009 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC), supporting that the circadian mechanism plays an important role in regulating cardiac growth. These findings demonstrate a crucial role for Clock in growth and renewal; disrupting Clock leads to age-dependent cardiomyopathy. Pharmacological targeting of the circadian mechanism provides a new opportunity for treating heart disease.},

The aim of the present study is to estimate the association between shift-work experience and change in cognitive performance before and after retirement age among older adults who were gainfully employed. Methods Five hundred and ninety five participants with no dementia were followed up for a mean of 17.6 standard deviation (SD) 8.8 years from a Swedish population-based sample. Participants had self-reported information on any type of shift-work experience (ever/never) in 1984 and measures of cognitive performance (verbal, spatial, memory, processing speed, and general cognitive ability) from up to 9 waves of cognitive assessments during 1986-2012. Night work history (ever/never) from 1998-2002 was available from a subsample (N=320). Early adult cognitive test scores were available for 77 men. Results In latent growth curve modeling, there were no main effects of "any-type" or night shift work on the mean scores or rate of change in any of the cognitive domains. An interaction effect between any-type shift work and education on cognitive performance at retirement was noted. Lower-educated shift workers performed better on cognitive tests than lower-educated day workers at retirement. Sensitivity analyses, however, indicated that the interactions appeared to be driven by selection effects. Lower-educated day workers demonstrated poorer cognitive ability in early adulthood than lower-educated shift workers, who may have selected jobs entailing higher cognitive demand. Conclusion There was no difference in late-life cognitive aging between individuals with a history of working shifts compared to those who had typical day work schedules during midlife.},

The Screening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) sample included 41,199 participants born 1900-1958 who participated in a telephone interview in 1998-2002 that asked about night work status and duration. Dementia diagnoses came from Swedish patient registers. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Potential confounders such as age, sex, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke were included in adjusted models. In genotyped subsamples (n = 2977 in STR-1973; n = 10,366 in SALT), APOE ε4 status was considered in models. A total of 983 (7.4\%) and 1979 (4.8\%) dementia cases were identified after a median of 41.2 and 14.1~years follow-up in the STR-1973 and SALT sample, respectively. Ever shift work (HR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.15-1.60) and night work (HR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.01-1.23) were associated with higher dementia incidence. Modest dose-response associations were observed, where longer duration shift work and night work predicted increased dementia risk. Among APOE ε4 carriers, individuals exposed to ≥\,20~years of shift work and night work had increased dementia risk compared to day workers.

Environmental stimuli are likely to modify sleep in both animals and people, suggesting that environmental stability must be controlled carefully by both husbandry and research staff to allow collection of valid results with minimal numbers of animals. However, few studies have measured the effects of cage condition on sleep parameters in mice. Current guidelines recommend social housing and environmental enrichment for standard rodent housing. Environmental factors such as these create potential confounds in studies for which facets of sleep are outcome measures. We therefore sought to determine whether cage changes, group housing, or single housing with a shelter altered measures of sleep in C57BL/6J mice. The resulting data indicate that 1) cage changing disrupts sleep for approximately 3 h; 2) group housing is associated with shorter bouts of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and less slow-wave sleep (SWS) during the light phase and with more REMS during the dark phase; and 3) mice housed with a shelter spend less time awake and more time in SWS, with longer bouts of SWS during the dark phase. In additional, both group housing and housing with a shelter were associated with less locomotor activity than occurred in individually housed mice without a shelter. These findings provide evidence for long-held beliefs that housing conditions must be controlled carefully in studies that require assessment of sleep.},

Noise peaks during work hours in room 1 occurred about two times as often as in room 2 (P = 0.01). Use of changing stations located in the rooms caused background noise to increase by about 10 dB.

However, less information is available on how aging alters circadian rhythmicity in a commonly studied rodent animal model, the mouse. Therefore, in the present study we compared the rhythm of wheel-running activity in adult (6–9 mo) and old (19–22 mo) C57BL/6J mice maintained under different lighting conditions for a period of 4 mo. During this period, mice were subjected to phase advances and phase delays of the light-dark (LD) cycle and eventually to constant darkness (DD). In LD (12 h light, 12 h dark), old mice exhibited delayed activity onset relative to light offset and an increase in the variability of activity onset compared with adult mice. After a 4-h phase advance of the LD cycle, old mice took significantly longer to reentrain their activity rhythm when compared with adult animals. Old mice also demonstrated a decline in the number of wheel revolutions per day and a tendency toward a decrease in the length of the active phase. An increase in fragmentation of activity across the 24-h day was obvious in aging animals, with bouts of activity being shorter and longer rest periods intervening between them. No age difference was detected in the maximum intensity of wheel-running activity. In DD, the free-running period was significantly longer in old mice compared with adults. In view of the rapidly expanding importance of the laboratory mouse for molecular and genetic studies of the mammalian nervous system, the present results provide a basis at the phenotypic level to begin to apply genetic methods to the analysis of circadian rhythms and aging in mammals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND
Obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Circadian rhythms are known to control both sleep timing and energy homeostasis, and disruptions in circadian rhythms have been linked with metabolic dysfunction and obesity-associated disease. In previous research, social jetlag, a measure of chronic circadian disruption caused by the discrepancy between our internal versus social clocks, was associated with elevated self-reported body mass index, possibly indicative of a more generalized association with obesity and metabolic dysfunction.

METHODS
We studied participants from the population-representative Dunedin Longitudinal Study (N = 1037) to determine whether social jetlag was associated with clinically assessed measurements of metabolic phenotypes and disease indicators for obesity-related disease, specifically, indicators of inflammation and diabetes.

RESULTS
Our analysis was restricted to N = 815 non-shift workers in our cohort. Among these participants, we found that social jetlag was associated with numerous clinically assessed measures of metabolic dysfunction and obesity. We distinguished between obese individuals who were metabolically healthy versus unhealthy, and found higher social jetlag levels in metabolically unhealthy obese individuals. Among metabolically unhealthy obese individuals, social jetlag was additionally associated with elevated glycated hemoglobin and an indicator of inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings are consistent with the possibility that ‘living against our internal clock’ may contribute to metabolic dysfunction and its consequences. Further research aimed at understanding that the physiology and social features of social jetlag may inform obesity prevention and have ramifications for policies and practices that contribute to increased social jetlag, such as work schedules and daylight savings time.},

  abstract = {Social jetlag, the misalignment between the internal clock and the socially required timing of activities, is highly prevalent, especially in people with an evening chronotype and is hypothesized to be related to the link between the evening chronotype and major depressive disorder. Although social jetlag has been linked to depressive symptoms in non-clinical samples, it has never been studied in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study is aimed to study social jetlag in patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls, and to further examine the link between social jetlag and depressive symptomatology. Patients with a diagnosis of MDD (n~=~1084) and healthy controls (n~=~385), assessed in a clinical interview, were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Social jetlag was derived from the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, by calculating the absolute difference between the midsleep on free days and midsleep on work days. Depression severity was measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. It was found that patients with MDD did not show more social jetlag compared to healthy controls, neither in a model without medication use (β~=~0.06, 95\% CI: -0.03-0.15, p~=~0.17) nor in a model where medication use is accounted for. There was no direct association between the amount of social jetlag and depressive symptoms, neither in the full sample, nor in the patient group or the healthy control group. This first study on social jetlag in a clinical sample showed no differences in social jetlag between patients with MDD and healthy controls.},

In this review, we address regulatory mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms in mammals and summarize recent literature describing the effects of aging on the circadian system.},

  abstract = {In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as a circadian clock that drives 24-hour rhythms in both physiology and behavior. The SCN is a multicellular oscillator in which individual neurons function as cell-autonomous oscillators. The production of a coherent output rhythm is dependent upon mutual synchronization among single cells and requires both synaptic communication and gap junctions. Changes in phase synchronization between individual cells have consequences on the amplitude of the SCN’s electrical activity rhythm, and these changes play a major role in the ability to adapt to seasonal changes. Both aging and sleep deprivation negatively affect the circadian amplitude of the SCN, whereas behavioral activity (i.e., exercise) has a positive effect on amplitude. Given that the amplitude of the SCN’s electrical activity rhythm is essential for achieving robust rhythmicity in physiology and behavior, the mechanisms that underlie neuronal synchronization warrant further study. A growing body of evidence suggests that the functional integrity of the SCN contributes to health, well-being, cognitive performance, and alertness; in contrast, deterioration of the 24-hour rhythm is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, cancer, depression, and sleep disorders.},

While there are undoubtedly many factors contributing to these changes, a body of literature is emerging, suggesting that an age-related decline in the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) may be a key element responsible. To explore age-related changes in the SCN, we have performed in vivo multiunit neural activity (MUA) recordings from the SCN of freely moving young (3-5 months) and middle-aged (13-18 months) mice. Importantly, the amplitude of day-night difference in MUA was significantly reduced in the older mice. We also found that the neural activity rhythms are clearly degraded in the subparaventricular zone, one of the main neural outputs of the SCN. Surprisingly, parallel studies indicate that the molecular clockwork in the SCN as measured by PER2 exhibited only minor deficits at this same age. Thus, the circadian output measured at the level of neural activity rhythms in the SCN is degraded by aging, and this decline occurs before the disruption of key components of the molecular clockwork.},

  abstract = {Aging produces a decline in the amplitude and precision of 24 h behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic rhythms, which are regulated in mammals by a central circadian pacemaker within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and local oscillators in peripheral tissues. Disruption of the circadian system, as experienced during transmeridian travel, can lead to adverse health consequences, particularly in the elderly. To test the hypothesis that age-related changes in the response to simulated jet lag will reflect altered circadian function, we examined re-entrainment of central and peripheral oscillators from young and old PER2::luciferase mice. As in previous studies, locomotor activity rhythms in older mice required more days to re-entrain following a shift than younger mice. At the tissue level, effects of age on baseline entrainment were evident, with older mice displaying earlier phases for the majority of peripheral oscillators studied and later phases for cells within most SCN subregions. Following a 6 h advance of the light:dark cycle, old mice displayed slower rates of re-entrainment for peripheral tissues but a larger, more rapid SCN response compared to younger mice. Thus, aging alters the circadian timing system in a manner that differentially affects the re-entrainment responses of central and peripheral circadian clocks. This pattern of results suggests that a major consequence of aging is a decrease in pacemaker amplitude, which would slow re-entrainment of peripheral oscillators and reduce SCN resistance to external perturbation.},

Analysis of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and of other circadian oscillators reveals age-related changes which are most profound in extra-SCN tissues. Some extra-SCN oscillators appear to stop oscillating in vivo or display altered phase relationships. To determine whether the dynamic behavior of circadian oscillators is also affected by aging we studied the resetting behavior of the Period1 transcriptional rhythm of peripheral and central oscillators in response to a 6 hr advance or delay in the light schedule. We employed a transgenic rat with a luciferase reporter to allow for real-time measurements of transcriptional rhythmicity. While phase-resetting in the SCN following an advance or a delay of the light cycle appears nearly normal in 2-year old rats, resynchronization of the liver was seriously disrupted. In addition, the arcuate nucleus and pineal gland exhibited faster resetting in aged rats relative to 4-8 month-old controls. The consequences of these deficits are unknown, but may contribute to organ and brain diseases in the aged as well as the health problems that are common in older shift-workers.},

Telomere shortening is the key mechanism driving replicative senescence in human fibroblasts. Later, pioneering work by Olivier Toussaint and others showed that stress plays a major role in the induction of senescence in vitro, a phenomenon known as stress-induced premature senescence or SIPS. It is also now widely accepted that senescence plays a role in vivo. An emerging body of evidence from animal models, and particularly mice, has demonstrated an important role for senescence in several processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, tumour suppression and ageing. However, mostly due to a lack of availability of tissues and specific markers, less is known about the importance of cell senescence in humans. In this review, we summarize some of the key findings in the field of senescence, stress-induced senescence and telomeres. We focus particularly on the role of telomere dysfunction and senescence during the ageing process as well as potential interventions, including pharmacological approaches like telomerase activators and senolytics, to counteract their detrimental effects in ageing and disease.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that epigenetics, especially DNA methylation, plays a mechanistic role in aging. Epigenetic clocks, which measure changes in a few hundred specific CpG sites, can accurately predict chronological age in a variety of species, including humans. These clocks are currently the best biomarkers for predicting mortality in humans. Additionally, several studies have characterized the effects of aging across the methylome in a wide variety of tissues from humans and mice. A small fraction (\textasciitilde{}2\%) of the CpG sites show age-related changes, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation with aging. Evaluation of non-CpG site methylation has only been examined in a few studies, with about \textasciitilde{}0.5\% of these sites showing a change with age. Therefore, while only a small fraction of cytosines in the genome show changes in DNA methylation with age, this represents 2 to 3 million cytosines in the genome. Importantly, the only study to compare the effect of aging on DNA methylation in male and female mice and humans found that {$>$}95\% of the age-related changes in DNA methylation in the hippocampus were sexually divergent, i.e., the methylation did not differ between males and females at young age but age-related changes occurred in one sex but not the other. The age-related changes in DNA methylation tend to be enriched and under-represented in specific genomic contexts, with some commonalities between tissues and species that require further investigation. The strongest evidence that the age-related changes in DNA methylation play a role in aging comes from studies of anti-aging interventions (e.g., caloric restriction, dwarfism, and rapamycin treatment) in mice. These anti-aging interventions deaccelerate the epigenetic clocks and reverse/prevent 20 to 40\% of the age-related changes in DNA methylation. It will be important in the future to demonstrate that at least some of the age-related changes in DNA methylation directly lead to alterations in the transcriptome of cells/tissues that could potentially contribute to aging.},

Treated, 3-month-old mice display many, but not all signs of normal liver ageing as early as 1 month after treatment, including ageing pathologies, markers of senescence, fused mitochondria and alterations in gene expression profiles.

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals that can synchronize or entrain to environmental cues. Although light exerts powerful influences on SCN output, other non-photic stimuli can modulate the SCN as well. We recently demonstrated that daily performance of a cognitive task requiring sustained periods of attentional effort that relies upon basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic activity dramatically alters circadian rhythms in rats. In particular, normally nocturnal rats adopt a robust diurnal activity pattern that persists for several days in the absence of cognitive training. Although anatomical and pharmacological data from non-performing animals support a relationship between cholinergic signaling and circadian rhythms, little is known about how endogenous cholinergic signaling influences SCN function in behaving animals. Here we report that BF cholinergic projections to the SCN provide the principal signal allowing for the expression of cognitive entrainment in light-phase trained animals. We also reveal that oscillator(s) outside of the SCN drive cognitive entrainment as daily timed cognitive training robustly entrains SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals. Ablation of the SCN, however, resulted in significant impairments in task acquisition, indicating that SCN-mediated timekeeping benefits new learning and cognitive performance. Taken together, we conclude that cognition entrains non-photic oscillators, and cholinergic signaling to the SCN serves as a temporal timestamp attenuating SCN photic-driven rhythms, thereby permitting cognitive demands to modulate behavior.},

  abstract = {Shift work comprises work schedules that extend beyond the typical “nine-to-five” workday, wherein schedules often comprise early work start, compressed work weeks with 12-hour shifts, and night work. According to recent American and European surveys, between 15 and 30\% of adult workers are engaged in some type of shift work, with 19\% of the European population reportedly working at least 2hours between 22:00 and 05:00. The 2005 International Classification of Sleep Disorders estimates that a shift work sleep disorder can be found in 2–5\% of workers. This disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or sleep disruption for at least one month in relation with the atypical work schedule. Individual tolerance to shift work remains a complex problem that is affected by the number of consecutive work hours and shifts, the rest periods, and the predictability of work schedules. Sleepiness usually occurs during night shifts and is maximal at the end of the night. Impaired vigilance and performance occur around times of increased sleepiness and can seriously compromise workers’ health and safety. Indeed, workers suffering from a shift work sleep-wake disorder can fall asleep involuntarily at work or while driving back home after a night shift. Working on atypical shifts has important socioeconomic impacts as it leads to an increased risk of accidents, workers’ impairment and danger to public safety, especially at night. The aim of the present review is to review the circadian and sleep-wake disturbances associated with shift work as well as their medical impacts.
Résumé
Le travail posté exige des périodes de travail qui sortent du cadre conventionnel des journées “de neuf à cinq”. Les horaires de travail comportent souvent un début de travail précoce, des horaires comprimés avec quarts de 12heures ainsi que des périodes de travail de nuit. Des enquêtes récentes américaine et européenne rapportent qu’entre 15 et 30~\% des travailleurs adultes travaillent sur un horaire non conventionnel, incluant 19~\% de la population européenne qui rapporte travailler au moins 2heures entre 22:00 et 05:00. La classification internationale des troubles de sommeil de 2005 estime qu’un désordre de sommeil lié au travail posté peut être observé chez 2–5~\% des travailleurs. Ce désordre se caractérise par de la somnolence excessive et/ou des perturbations du sommeil pendant au moins un mois en relation avec l’horaire atypique de travail. La tolérance d’un individu au travail posté demeure un problème complexe qui dépend du nombre d’heures et de quarts consécutifs de travail, des périodes de repos et de l’aspect prévisible de l’horaire de travail. La somnolence survient généralement la nuit et est maximale en fin de nuit. Les perturbations de vigilance et de performance surviennent lors des périodes de somnolence accrue et peuvent compromettre sérieusement la santé et sécurité des travailleurs. En effet, les travailleurs souffrant du désordre de sommeil lié au travail posté peuvent s’endormir involontairement au travail et en conduisant lors du retour à domicile après un quart de nuit. Le travail posté a d’importantes implications socioéconomiques en raison du risque accru d’accidents, de l’altération des capacités des travailleurs et des dangers de sécurité publique qu’il comporte, en particulier la nuit. Le but du présent ouvrage est de revoir les troubles des rythmes circadiens et du cycle veille-sommeil liés au travail posté ainsi que leurs implications médicales.},

  abstract = {Single-laboratory studies conducted under highly standardized conditions are the gold standard in preclinical animal research. Using simulations based on 440 preclinical studies across 13 different interventions in animal models of stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer, we compared the accuracy of effect size estimates between single-laboratory and multi-laboratory study designs. Single-laboratory studies generally failed to predict effect size accurately, and larger sample sizes rendered effect size estimates even less accurate. By contrast, multi-laboratory designs including as few as 2 to 4 laboratories increased coverage probability by up to 42 percentage points without a need for larger sample sizes. These findings demonstrate that within-study standardization is a major cause of poor reproducibility. More representative study samples are required to improve the external validity and reproducibility of preclinical animal research and to prevent wasting animals and resources for inconclusive research.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that environmental standardization is the best way to guarantee reproducible results in animal experiments. However, mounting evidence indicates that even subtle differences in laboratory or test conditions can lead to conflicting test outcomes. Because experimental treatments may interact with environmental conditions, experiments conducted under highly standardized conditions may reveal local 'truths' with little external validity. We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Environmental standardization can contribute to spurious and conflicting findings in the literature and unnecessary animal use. This conclusion calls for research into practicable and effective ways of systematic environmental heterogenization to attenuate these scientific, economic and ethical costs.},

In this review, we discuss recent advances, controversies, opportunities, and challenges surrounding the development of SIRT1 activators, molecules with the potential to delay aging and age-related diseases. Sirtuins comprise a family of NAD⁺-dependent deacylases that are central to the body's response to diet and exercise. New studies indicate that both natural and synthetic sirtuin activating compounds (STACs) work via a common allosteric mechanism to stimulate sirtuin activity, thereby conferring broad health benefits in rodents, primates, and possibly humans. The fact that two-thirds of people in the USA who consume multiple dietary supplements consume resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, underscores the importance of understanding the biochemical mechanism, physiological effects, and safety of STACs.},

  abstract = {Aging as a research pursuit is fairly new compared with traditional lines of medical research. A growing field of investigators is focused on understanding how changes in tissue biology, physiology, and systemic homeostasis, conspire to create increased vulnerability to disease as a function of age. Aging research as a discipline is necessarily broad; in part because aging itself is multi-faceted and in part because different model systems are employed to define the underlying biology. In this review we outline aspects of aging research that are likely to uncover the pivotal events leading to age-related disease vulnerability. We focus on studies of human aging and discuss the value of research on caloric restriction, an intervention with proven efficacy in delaying aging. We propose that studies such as these will deliver target factors and processes that create vulnerability in human aging, an advance that would potentially be transformative in clinical care.,

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are physiological and behavioral oscillations that have period lengths of approximately 24 h. In mammals, circadian rhythms are driven by a master pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). These rhythms can be entrained to light:dark cycles through photic and non-photic cues. Current research suggests that the SCN re-entrains rapidly to new light:dark (LD) cycles with the first photic cues, whereas peripheral tissues re-entrain more slowly, leading to a transient state of internal disorder while the organism adjusts to the new timing of photic input. To assess internal temporal order during the readjustment we used dim light to slow the rate of re-entrainment following a 12-h inversion of the LD cycle. We also used a wheel-restriction paradigm, which can block behavioral evidence of re-entrainment. Per2(Luc) mice were entrained to a 12:12 dim LD cycle with wheel access ad libitum. Following a 12-h shift in the LD cycle, some animals were subjected to wheel restriction; wheels were locked during the new dark period and available during the new light period. Other mice had wheels available ad lib throughout the experiment. Behavioral actograms of general locomotor activity as measured with motion sensors indicated that mice with ad lib access to wheels were able to re-entrain at a rate significantly faster than mice with restricted wheel access. Up to 2 weeks following the LD inversion many wheel-restricted animals were still active predominantly in the new light period. Phase of the PER2::LUC bioluminescence rhythms in SCN and four peripheral tissues (lung, esophagus, thymus, and spleen), measured ex vivo on days 2, 9, and 16 following the inversion, indicated that within each condition the SCN and peripheral tissues shifted at the same rate, whereas the rate of re-entrainment for the tissues differed between conditions. Ex vivo data showed that the PER2::LUC peaks in SCN and peripheral tissues were closely linked to time of activity onset in both groups. Thus, this wheel restriction protocol is capable of reducing and in some cases apparently hindering photic re-entrainment of the circadian system, verifying this protocol as a mechanism for study of photic/non-photic entrainment interactions. Our results suggest that LD inversion under dim light and a wheel-restriction protocol does not induce internal desynchrony, indicating that slowing the rate of shift by limiting both entrainment inputs may induce less "jet lag".},

When administered to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, NOB strongly counteracted metabolic syndrome and augmented energy expenditure and locomotor activity in a Clock gene-dependent manner. In db/db mutant mice, the clock is also required for the mitigating effects of NOB on metabolic disorders. In DIO mouse liver, NOB enhanced clock protein levels and elicited pronounced gene expression remodeling.

We studied the effects of age and exercise on baseline circadian rhythms and on the circadian system's ability to respond to the perturbation induced by an 8~h advance of the light:dark (LD) cycle as a test of the system's robustness. Mice (male, mPer2luc/C57BL/6) were studied at one of two ages: 3.5~months (n\,=\,39) and {$>$}18~months (n\,=\,72). We examined activity records of these mice under entrained and shifted conditions as well as mPER2::LUC measures ex vivo to assess circadian function in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and important target organs. Age was associated with reduced running wheel use, fragmentation of activity, and slowed resetting in both behavioral and molecular measures. Furthermore, we observed that for aged mice, the presence of a running wheel altered the amplitude of the spontaneous firing rate rhythm in the SCN in vitro. Following a shift of the LD cycle, both young and aged mice showed a change in rhythmicity properties of the mPER2::LUC oscillation of the SCN in vitro, and aged mice exhibited longer lasting internal desynchrony. Access to a running wheel alleviated some age-related changes in the circadian system. In an additional experiment, we replicated the effect of the running wheel, comparing behavioral and in vitro results from aged mice housed with or without a running wheel ({$>$}21~months, n\,=\,8 per group, all examined 4~days after the shift). The impact of voluntary exercise on circadian rhythm properties in an aged animal is a novel finding and has implications for the health of older people living with environmentally induced circadian disruption.},

Aging results in structural changes and functional decline of the cardiovascular system and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Aging not only increases the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases but is also associated with impaired responses to cardiovascular diseases. This supports the notion that age-related changes in the cardiovascular system superimpose and interact with the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular disease.

The method of longitudinal Gompertzian analysis demonstrates that aging and mortality are deterministically linked. Moreover, this method of analysis reveals that with enhanced human survival, mortality patterns have changed primarily as the result of the unmasking of latent susceptibilities to other Gompertzian diseases rather than altered environmental etiopathogenic influences. That is, the Gompertzian model of human aging and mortality suggests that redundant programmed failure is the primary reason for ultimate and inevitable mortality. A process by which redundant deterministic disease susceptibilities could accumulate within the genome is natural 'non-selection'. Random genetic mutations which enhance survival until reproduction facilitate the processes of natural selection and evolution. However, random genetic mutations that program for late failure or disease susceptibility would not be eliminated from the gene pool. Thus, random genetic mutations which have programmed for late susceptibility to Gompertzian diseases, and their cumulative non-selection, may be the basis for the deterministic relationship between aging and mortality.},

One of the least understood aspects of life in the dark biosphere is the rhythmicity of physiology and what it means to live in an environment of low or no rhythmicity. Here we describe methods that may be used to understand rhythmic physiology in the dark and summarise some of the studies of rhythmic physiology in "arrhythmic" environments, such as the poles, deep sea and caves.

To study such coupling, we investigated the effects of cycles of food availability (which exert powerful entraining effects on behavior) on the rhythms of gene expression in the liver, lung, and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We used a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although rhythmicity in the SCN remained phase-locked to the light-dark cycle, restricted feeding rapidly entrained the liver, shifting its rhythm by 10 hours within 2 days. Our results demonstrate that feeding cycles can entrain the liver independently of the SCN and the light cycle, and they suggest the need to reexamine the mammalian circadian hierarchy. They also raise the possibility that peripheral circadian oscillators like those in the liver may be coupled to the SCN primarily through rhythmic behavior, such as feeding.},

However, since the introduction of electric lighting, there has been inadequate light during the day inside buildings for a robust resetting of the human endogenous circadian rhythmicity, and too much light at night for a true dark to be detected; this results in circadian disruption and alters sleep/wake cycle, core body temperature, hormone regulation and release, and patterns of gene expression throughout the body. The question is the extent to which circadian disruption compromises human health, and can account for a portion of the modern pandemics of breast and prostate cancers, obesity, diabetes and depression. As societies modernize (i.e. electrify) these conditions increase in prevalence. There are a number of promising leads on putative mechanisms, and epidemiological findings supporting an aetiologic role for electric lighting in disease causation. These include melatonin suppression, circadian gene expression, and connection of circadian rhythmicity to metabolism in part affected by haem iron intake and distribution.},

  abstract = {Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity. This so-called "chronotype" is largely regulated by the circadian clock. Both genetic variations in clock genes and environmental influences contribute to the distribution of chronotypes in a given population, ranging from extreme early types to extreme late types with the majority falling between these extremes. Social (e.g., school and work) schedules interfere considerably with individual sleep preferences in the majority of the population. Late chronotypes show the largest differences in sleep timing between work and free days leading to a considerable sleep debt on work days, for which they compensate on free days. The discrepancy between work and free days, between social and biological time, can be described as 'social jetlag.' Here, we explore how sleep quality and psychological wellbeing are associated with individual chronotype and/or social jetlag. A total of 501 volunteers filled out the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) as well as additional questionnaires on: (i) sleep quality (SF-A), (ii) current psychological wellbeing (Basler Befindlichkeitsbogen), (iii) retrospective psychological wellbeing over the past week (POMS), and (iv) consumption of stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol). Associations of chronotype, wellbeing, and stimulant consumption are strongest in teenagers and young adults up to age 25 yrs. The most striking correlation exists between chronotype and smoking, which is significantly higher in late chronotypes of all ages (except for those in retirement). We show these correlations are most probably a consequence of social jetlag, i.e., the discrepancies between social and biological timing rather than a simple association to different chronotypes. Our results strongly suggest that work (and school) schedules should be adapted to chronotype whenever possible.},

  title = {A Role for Cryptochromes in Sleep Regulation},
  volume = {3},
  issn = {1471-2202},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes (cry1 and cry2) are necessary for the generation of circadian rhythms, as mice lacking both of these genes (cry1,2-/-) lack circadian rhythms. We studied sleep in cry1,2-/- mice under baseline conditions as well as under conditions of constant darkness and enforced wakefulness to determine whether cryptochromes influence sleep regulatory processes.
RESULTS: Under all three conditions, cry1,2-/- mice exhibit the hallmarks of high non-REM sleep (NREMS) drive (i.e., increases in NREMS time, NREMS consolidation, and EEG delta power during NREMS). This unexpected phenotype was associated with elevated brain mRNA levels of period 1 and 2 (per1,2), and albumin d-binding protein (dbp), which are known to be transcriptionally inhibited by CRY1,2. To further examine the relationship between circadian genes and sleep homeostasis, we examined wild type mice and rats following sleep deprivation and found increased levels of per1,2 mRNA and decreased levels of dbp mRNA specifically in the cerebral cortex; these changes subsided with recovery sleep. The expression of per3, cry1,2, clock, npas2, bmal1, and casein-kinase-1epsilon did not change with sleep deprivation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that mice lacking cryptochromes are not simply a genetic model of circadian arrhythmicity in rodents and functionally implicate cryptochromes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The finding that deletion or mutation of core circadian clock genes in both mice and flies induce unexpected alterations in sleep amount, sleep architecture and the recovery response to sleep deprivation, has led to new insights into functions of the circadian system that extend beyond its role as a regulator of the timing of the sleep-wake cycle. A key transcription factor in the transcriptional/translational feedback loop of mammalian circadian genes is BMAL1/Mop3, a heterodimeric partner to CLOCK. It was previously shown that mice deficient in the BMAL1/Mop3 gene become immediately arrhythmic in constant darkness and have reduced locomotor activity levels under entrained and constant conditions. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mammalian BMAL1/Mop3 gene would have regulatory effects on sleep-wake patterns.
DESIGN: In mice with targeted deletion of the BMAL1/Mop3 gene, EEG/EMG sleep-wake patterns were recorded under entrained and free-running conditions as well as following acute (6-hrs) sleep deprivation.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mice homozygous for the BMAL1/Mop3 deletion showed an attenuated rhythm of sleep and wakefulness distribution across the 24-hr period. In addition, these mice showed increases in total sleep time, sleep fragmentation and EEG delta power under baseline conditions, and an attenuated compensatory response to acute sleep deprivation.
CONCLUSIONS: These new data strengthen the hypothesis that molecular components of the circadian system play a central role in the generation of sleep and wakefulness beyond just the timing of these behavioral vigilance states.},

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock controlling daily behavior in mammals. It consists of a heterogeneous network of neurons, in which cell-autonomous molecular feedback loops determine the period and amplitude of circadian oscillations of individual cells. In contrast, circuit-level properties of coherence, synchrony, and ensemble period are determined by intercellular signals and are embodied in a circadian wave of gene expression that progresses daily across the SCN. How cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms interact in timekeeping is poorly understood. To explore this interaction, we used intersectional genetics to create temporally chimeric mice with SCN containing dopamine 1a receptor (Drd1a) cells with an intrinsic period of 24 h alongside non-Drd1a cells with 20-h clocks. Recording of circadian behavior in vivo alongside cellular molecular pacemaking in SCN slices in vitro demonstrated that such chimeric circuits form robust and resilient circadian clocks. It also showed that the computation of ensemble period is nonlinear. Moreover, the chimeric circuit sustained a wave of gene expression comparable to that of nonchimeric SCN, demonstrating that this circuit-level property is independent of differences in cell-intrinsic periods. The relative dominance of 24-h Drd1a and 20-h non-Drd1a neurons in setting ensemble period could be switched by exposure to resonant or nonresonant 24-h or 20-h lighting cycles. The chimeric circuit therefore reveals unanticipated principles of circuit-level operation underlying the emergent plasticity, resilience, and robustness of the SCN clock. The spontaneous and light-driven flexibility of period observed in chimeric mice provides a new perspective on the concept of SCN pacemaker cells.},

  abstract = {Daily feeding schedules entrain temporal patterns of behavior, metabolism, neuronal activity and clock gene expression in several brain areas and periphery while the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the biological clock, remains coupled to the light/dark cycle. Because bilateral lesions of the SCN do not abolish food entrained behavioral and hormonal rhythms it is suggested that food entrained and light entrained systems are independent of each other. Special circumstances indicate a possible interaction between the light and the food entrained systems and indicate modulation of SCN activity by restricted feeding. This study explores the influence of the SCN on food entrained rhythms. Food entrained temporal profiles of behavior, core temperature, corticosterone and glucose, as well as Fos and PER1 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus and corticolimbic structures were explored in rats bearing bilateral SCN lesions (SCNX). In SCNX rats food anticipatory activity and the food entrained temperature and corticosterone increase were expressed with earlier onset and higher values than in intact controls. Glucose levels were lower in SCNX rats in all time points and SCNX rats anticipation to a meal induced higher c-Fos positive neurons in the hypothalamus, while a decreased c-Fos response was observed in corticolimbic structures. SCNX rats also exhibited an upregulation of the PER1 peak in hypothalamic structures, especially in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), while in some limbic structures PER1 rhythmicity was dampened. The present results indicate that the SCN participates actively during food entrainment modulating the response of hypothalamic and corticolimbic structures, resulting in an increased anticipatory response.},

These include responses to daily methamphetamine (MAP) injection, or daily restricted feeding. The mechanisms underlying these SCN-independent circadian rhythms are unknown. A circadian oscillation in the expression of mPer1 and/or mPer2, mouse period, in the SCN is considered necessary to generate an SCN-dependent circadian rhythm. Therefore, in this experiment, we examined the association between mPer gene expression and the MAP-induced, SCN-independent circadian rhythm. Acute injection of MAP caused an elevation of mPer1, mBmal1, and mNpas2 gene expression in the striatum and mPer1 in the liver. Daily MAP injection at a fixed time for 6 days shifted the rhythmic mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the striatum from a nocturnal to a diurnal rhythm, but failed to affect that in the SCN. Although lesion of the SCN ‘flattened’mPer gene oscillation in the striatum and liver, daily MAP injection caused both behavioural and mPer gene expression rhythms. Daily MAP injection at variable injection intervals (12–36 h) for 6 days, however, failed to produce mPer gene rhythm in the striatum. Daily repeated MAP signals may strengthen the oscillatory force of SCN-independent circadian behavioural and molecular rhythms. The present results suggest that daily oscillation of mPer genes outside the SCN is closely associated with the regulation of SCN-independent rhythms. Thus, the present experiment highlights strongly the important role of clock gene expression, in the brain, that underlies the circadian behavioural rhythm.},

Surprisingly, most sleep-amount, but not sleep-timing, phenotypes could be reproduced or rescued by knocking out or restoring BMAL1 exclusively in skeletal muscle, respectively. We also found that overexpression of skeletal-muscle Bmal1 reduced the recovery response to sleep loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that Bmal1 expression in skeletal muscle is both necessary and sufficient to regulate total sleep amount and reveal that critical components of normal sleep regulation occur in muscle.},

We also carried out selective sleep deprivation experiments to confirm that changes in SCN electrical activity are caused by changes in vigilance state.

It has been described about 10\% of the genome is controlled by clock genes, with special relevance, due to its implications, to the cell cycle. Ageing is a deleterious process which affects all the organisms' structures including circadian system. The circadian system's ageing may produce a disorganisation among the circadian rhythms, arrhythmicity and, even, disconnection from the environment, resulting in a detrimental situation to the organism. In addition, some environmental conditions can produce circadian disruption, also called chronodisruption, which may produce many pathologies including accelerated ageing. Finally, some strategies to prevent, palliate or counteract chronodisruption effects have been proposed to enhance the circadian system, also called chronoenhancement. This review tries to gather recent advances in the chronobiology of the ageing process, including cell cycle, neurogenesis process and physiology.},

During the continuous recordings the rats were maintained in isolated cabins under constant temperature and constant dim, red light. The period length and amplitude of the free-running circadian rhythms of wakefulness (W), slow wave sleep (SWS) and desynchronized sleep (DS) were estimated by means of a cosine curve fitting program. Age-related amplitude differences were absent under the constant recording conditions. The circadian period of the W- and DS-rhythms, however, was significantly shorter in the old rats. These results are consistent with the notion that circadian organization is changed in old age.},

In the absence of environmental time cues, circadian rhythms default to their endogenous period called tau, or the free-running period. This sustained circadian rhythmicity in constant conditions has been reported across the animal kingdom, a ubiquity that could imply that innate rhythmicity confers an adaptive advantage. In this study, we found that the deviation of tau from 24 h was inversely related to the lifespan in laboratory mouse strains, and in other rodent and primate species. These findings support the hypothesis that misalignment of endogenous rhythms and 24 h environmental cycles may be associated with a physiological cost that has an effect on longevity.},

Altered circadian rhythms also predict for poor survival in cancer patients, whereas physical destruction of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker, accelerates tumor growth in mice. Here we tested the effect of functional disruption of circadian system on tumor progression in a novel experimental model of chronic jet lag. B6D2F1 mice were synchronized with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness or underwent repeat 8-hour advances of the light/dark cycle every 2 days before inoculation of Glasgow osteosarcoma. The 24-hour changes were assessed for plasma corticosterone, clock protein mPER1 expression in the SCN, and mRNA expression of clock genes mPer2 and mRev-erbα in liver and tumor. Time series were analyzed by spectral analysis and/or Cosinor. Differences were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 24-hour rest/activity cycle was ablated, and the rhythms of body temperature, serum corticosterone, and mPER1 protein expression in the SCN were markedly altered in jet-lagged mice as compared with controls (ANOVA, P {$<$} 0.001 for corticosterone and P = 0.01 for mPER1). Tumor grew faster in the jet-lagged animals as compared with controls (ANOVA, P {$<$} 0.001), whereas exposure to constant light or darkness had no effect (ANOVA, P = 0.66 and P = 0.8, respectively). The expression of mPer2 and mRev-erbα mRNAs in controls showed significant circadian rhythms in the liver (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003, respectively, Cosinor) and in the tumor (P = 0.04 and P {$<$} 0.001). Both rhythms were suppressed in the liver (P = 0.2 and P = 0.1, respectively, Cosinor) and in the tumor (P = 0.5) of jet-lagged mice. Altered environmental conditions can disrupt circadian clock molecular coordination in peripheral organs including tumors and play a significant role in malignant progression.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms take place with a periodicity of 24 hr, temporally following the rotation of the earth around its axis. Examples of circadian rhythms are the sleep/wake cycle, feeding, and hormone secretion. Light powerfully entrains the mammalian clock and assists in keeping animals synchronized to the 24-hour cycle of the earth by activating specific neurons in the "central pacemaker" of the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Absolute periodicity of an animal can deviate slightly from 24 hr as manifest when an animal is placed into constant dark or "free-running" conditions. Simple measurements of an organism's activity in free-running conditions reveal its intrinsic circadian period. Mice are a particularly useful model for studying circadian rhythmicity due to the ease of genetic manipulation, thus identifying molecular contributors to rhythmicity. Furthermore, their small size allows for monitoring locomotion or activity in their homecage environment with relative ease. Several tasks commonly used to analyze circadian periodicity and plasticity in mice are presented here including the process of entrainment, determination of tau (period length) in free-running conditions, determination of circadian periodicity in response to light disruption (e.g., jet lag studies), and evaluation of clock plasticity in non-24-hour conditions (T-cycles). Studying the properties of circadian periods such as their phase, amplitude, and length in response to photic perturbation, can be particularly useful in understanding how humans respond to jet lag, night shifts, rotating shifts, or other transient or chronic disruption of environmental surroundings.},

  abstract = {For animals living in temperate latitudes, seasonal changes in day length are an important cue for adaptations of their physiology and behavior to the altered environmental conditions. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is known as the central circadian clock in mammals, but may also play an important role in adaptations to different photoperiods. The SCN receives direct light input from the retina and is able to encode day-length by approximating the waveform of the electrical activity rhythm to the duration of daylight. Changing the overall waveform requires a reorganization of the neuronal network within the SCN with a change in the degree of synchrony between the neurons; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet unknown. In the present study we used PER2::LUC bioluminescence imaging in cultured SCN slices to characterize network dynamics on the single-cell level and we aimed to provide evidence for a role of modulations in coupling strength in the photoperiodic-induced phase dispersal. Exposure to long photoperiod (LP) induced a larger distribution of peak times of the single-cell PER2::LUC rhythms in the anterior SCN, compared to short photoperiod. Interestingly, the cycle-to-cycle variability in single-cell period of PER2::LUC rhythms is also higher in the anterior SCN in LP, and is positively correlated with peak time dispersal. Applying a new, impartial community detection method on the time series data of the PER2::LUC rhythm revealed two clusters of cells with a specific spatial distribution, which we define as dorsolateral and ventromedial SCN. Post hoc analysis of rhythm characteristics of these clusters showed larger cycle-to-cycle single-cell period variability in the dorsolateral compared to the ventromedial cluster in the anterior SCN. We conclude that a change in coupling strength within the SCN network is a plausible explanation to the observed changes in single-cell period variability, which can contribute to the photoperiod-induced phase distribution.},

  abstract = {Exposure to light at night is a disruptive condition for the adult circadian system, leading to arrhythmicity in nocturnal rodents. Circadian disruption is a risk factor for developing physiological and behavioral alterations, including weight gain and metabolic disease. During early stages of development, the circadian system undergoes a critical period of adjustment, and it is especially vulnerable to altered lighting conditions that may program its function, leading to long-term effects. We hypothesized that during lactation a disrupted light-dark cycle due to light at night may disrupt the circadian system and in the long term induce metabolic disorders. Here we explored in pups, short- and long-term effects of constant light (LL) during lactation. In the short term, LL caused a loss of rhythmicity and a reduction in the immunopositive cells of VIP, AVP, and PER1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In the short term, the affection on the circadian clock in the pups resulted in body weight gain, loss of daily rhythms in general activity, plasma glucose and triglycerides (TG). Importantly, the DD conditions during development also induced altered daily rhythms in general activity and in the SCN. Exposure to LD conditions after lactation did not restore rhythmicity in the SCN, and the number of immunopositve cells to VIP, AVP, and PER1 remained reduced. In the long term, daily rhythmicity in general activity was restored; however, daily rhythms in glucose and TG remained disrupted, and daily mean levels of TG were significantly increased. Present results point out the programming role played by the LD cycle during early development in the function of the circadian system and on metabolism. This study points out the risk represented by exposure to an altered light-dark cycle during early stages of development.

Light plays an essential role in maintaining alertness levels. Like other non-image-forming responses, the alerting effect of light is influenced by its spectral wavelength, duration and intensity. Alertness levels are also dependent on circadian rhythm (process C) and homeostatic sleep pressure (process S), consistent with the classic two-process model of sleep regulation. Over the last decade, there has been increasing recognition of an additional process (referred to as the third process) in sleep regulation. This third process seems to receive sensory inputs from body systems such as digestion, and is usually synchronised with process C and process S. Previous studies on the alerting effect of light have been mostly conducted in laboratories. Although these studies are helpful in delineating the impact of process C and process S, their ability to assist in understanding the third process is limited. This systematic review investigated the factors that influence the alerting effect of light by examining randomised controlled trials and randomised or counterbalanced crossover studies. Factors that influence light's alerting effect were examined with reference to the three-process model. The post-illuminance alerting effect was examined separately due to its potential to offer flexible workplace-based light interventions to increase or maintain employees' alertness.},

  abstract = {Summary
Light exerts a strong non-visual influence on human physiology and behavior. Additionally light is known to affect sleep indirectly through the phase shifting of circadian rhythms, and directly, promoting alertness in humans and sleep in nocturnal species. Little attention has been paid to the direct non-image-forming influence of light until recently with the discovery and emerging knowledge on melanopsin, a photopigment which is maximally sensitive to the blue spectrum of light and expressed in a subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Indeed, the development of transgenic mouse models targeting different phototransduction pathways has allowed researchers to decipher the mechanisms by which mammals adapt sleep to their light environment. This review summarizes the novel concepts and discrepancies from recent publications relating to the non-circadian effects of light on sleep and waking. Specifically, we discuss whether darkness, in addition to light, affects their quality. Furthermore, we seek to understand whether longer sustained periods of light exposure can influence sleep, if the direct photic regulation depends on time of day, and whether this affects the homeostatic sleep process. Moreover, the neural pathways by which light exerts a direct influence on sleep will be discussed including the respective role of rods/cones and melanopsin. Finally, we suggest that light weighs on the components of the flip-flop switch model to induce respectively sleep or waking, in nocturnal and diurnal animals. Taking these data into account we therefore propose a novel model of sleep regulation based on three processes; the direct photic regulation interacting with the circadian and homeostatic drives to determine the timing and quality of sleep and waking. An outlook of promising clinical and non-clinical applications of these findings will be considered as well as directions for future animal and human research.},

  abstract = {The role of serotonin (5-HT) in sleep is controversial: early studies suggested a sleep-promoting role, but eventually the paradigm shifted toward a wake-promoting function for the serotonergic raphe. Here, we provide evidence from zebrafish and mice that the raphe are critical for the initiation and maintenance of sleep. In zebrafish, genetic ablation of 5-HT production by the raphe reduces sleep, sleep depth, and the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation. Pharmacological inhibition or ablation of the raphe reduces sleep, while optogenetic stimulation increases sleep. Similarly, in mice, ablation of the raphe increases wakefulness and impairs the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, whereas tonic optogenetic stimulation at a rate similar to baseline activity induces sleep. Interestingly, burst optogenetic stimulation induces wakefulness in accordance with previously described burst activity of the raphe during arousing stimuli. These results indicate that the serotonergic system promotes sleep in both diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal rodents. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

The circuit mechanism coordinating these changes during sleep-wake transitions remains poorly understood. The past few years have witnessed rapid progress in the identification of REM and NREM sleep neurons, which constitute highly distributed networks spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Here we propose an arousal-action circuit for sleep-wake control in which wakefulness is supported by separate arousal and action neurons, while REM and NREM sleep neurons are part of the central somatic and autonomic motor circuits. This model is well supported by the currently known sleep and wake neurons. It can also account for the EEG, EMG, and autonomic profiles of wake, REM, and NREM states and several key features of their transitions. The intimate association between the sleep and autonomic/somatic motor control circuits suggests that a primary function of sleep is to suppress motor activity.},

It is essential that laboratory vivaria be designed to properly control the light conditions in which laboratory mice are housed; however, this is not universally the case. Some laboratory vivarium doors are designed with windows, which allow light from the hallways to leak into the housing space during the rodents’ dark phase. Personnel entering and exiting the housing space during the dark phase can also create excessive light leak from brightly illuminated hallways. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night, as commonly experienced in many laboratory rodent housing spaces, alters mouse (Mus musculus) behaviour. We specifically analysed patterns of locomotor activity, anxiety- and depressive-like responses. Exposure to dim (5 lux) light at night altered home-cage locomotor activity and increased anxiety and some depressive responses among laboratory mice. These results suggest that light conditions can alter mouse behaviour and potentially influence experimental outcomes. Increased care should be taken to properly control light-dark conditions for laboratory animals.},

  abstract = {During much of sleep, the cerebral cortex is rippled by slow waves, which appear in the electroencephalogram as oscillations between 0.5 and 4.5 Hz. Slow waves are regulated as a function of previous wakefulness, being maximal at the beginning of sleep and then progressively returning to a baseline level. This paper discusses a hypothesis about the significance of slow-wave activity and its homeostatic regulation. The hypothesis is as follows: 1. Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation in several cortical circuits; 2. Synaptic potentiation is tied to the homeostatic regulation of slow-wave activity; 3. Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic downscaling; 4. Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep on performance. The hypothesized link between sleep and synaptic homeostasis is supported by several lines of evidence and leads to testable predictions.},
