Writing
- What do we need to  do/how change?
- Read current version see what comes to mind

- Need to condense down introduction
- What does a good example look like?
- Somnotate paper probably a good examplea
    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10824458/
- probably need to know more about results/discussion
before writing more intro

- Question
- what am I arguing in this paper?

Constant light increases sleep during subjective dark, with reduced
power leading to normally maintained homeostasis
- fine statement but basically only asking the question of what does
constant light do? 

- What question am I asking? 
- what happens to sleep when we disrupt the circadian system?
- circadian regulates sleep timing
- constant light disrupts locomotor activity and circadian system
- what happens to homeostatic process when not getting normal circadian 
signals

- Sleep regulated by homeostatic and circadian system
- disruption of the circadian system has many negative effects 
- constant light disrupts the circadian system 
- previous increase in NREM, but what happens to homeostatic 
regulation?




Constant light causes sleep during first few hours of subjective dark
- Cannot be homeostatic as no change
- Can't be circadian as no change?
- must be direct light induced 

What does this sleep look like?
- Homeostatic reduced power but maintained SWE
- circadian ??? abnormal for time of day
- direct 

What do we care about what the sleep looks like? 
- episode duration?
- power spectra - delta power specifically?
- Other ideas - read something like Mathildes paper

What do we know about directly light induced sleep?
- T1/7 etc. 
- depends on circadian phase? 
- What does power, episode duration
- Direct effects previously described as masking circadian effects
- Hubbard 2021
- Does not require melanopsin Tsai 2009, but is stopped by loss 
of iPRGCs 


- important point - not arrhythmic due to low light intensity
100-120 lux super low LED light
Given this Ohta paper shows not desynchronised therefore what
are we even doing?


argh why do we care?
How does this fit with what we know about sleep regulation?

Homeostasis causes increased sleep need and intensity after 
prolonged waking. 
We see normal SWE with increased sleep therefore this cannot
be due to increased homeostatic pressure.

Circadian?
Given see changes immediately, not enough time to cause 
major change to circadian signal, should be robust to 
short term changes as that's the entire point?
How long does it take to cause disruption in the ohta paper?
Housed under LL 3-5 months, arrythmic after 120 days!!!
